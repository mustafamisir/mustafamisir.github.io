The uncertainty of the processing time is an important practical characteristic in manufacturing. By considering the processing time to be fuzzy variable, the FJSP with fuzzy processing time (FJSPF) is more close to the reality. This paper proposes an effective backtracking search based hyper-heuristic (BS-HH) approach to address the FJSPF. Firstly, six simple and efficient heuristics are incorporated into the BS-HH to construct a set of low-level heuristics. Secondly, a backtracking search algorithm is introduced as the high-level strategy to manage the low-level heuristics to operate on the solution domain. Additionally, a novel hybrid solution decoding scheme is proposed to find an optimal solution more efficiently. Finally, the performance of the BS-HH is evaluated on two typical benchmark sets. The results show that the proposed hyper-heuristic outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in solving the FJSPF.</p></span></span></span></li>

In this research a novel Grid algorithm is introduced, and improvement methods: Grid-BLP and Grid-Shaking. These algorithms were combined with genetic algorithm, and a novel placement order All equal first. An individual representation of a genetic algorithm has been developed that is consisted of placement sequence, rotation of a cutting part, the choice of a placement algorithm, and dynamic grid parameter. Experiments were conducted to determine the best placement algorithm for a dataset, and hyper-heuristic efficiency. The implementation has been developed and experiments were conducted in MATLAB using GEATbx toolbox on five datasets from textile industry: ALBANO, DAGLI, MAO, MARQUES and MAN SHIRT. The marker efficiency in percentage was recorded with best results: 85.17, 81.76, 78.67, 84.67 and 87.19% obtained for the datasets, respectively.</p></span></span></span></li>

In real production, dispatching rules are frequently used to react to disruptions. However, the man-made rules have strong problem relevance, and the quality of results depends on the problem itself. The motivation of this paper is to generate effective scheduling policies (SPs) through off-line learning and to implement the evolved SPs online for fast application. Thus, the dynamic scheduling effectiveness can be achieved, and it will save the cost of expertise and facilitate large-scale applications. Three types of hyper-heuristic methods were proposed in this paper for coevolution of the machine assignment rules and job sequencing rules to solve the multi-objective dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problem, including the multi-objective cooperative coevolution genetic programming with two sub-populations, the multi-objective genetic programming with two sub-trees, and the multi-objective genetic expression programming with two chromosomes. Both the training and testing results demonstrate that the CCGP-NSGAII method is more competitive than other evolutionary approaches. To investigate the generalization performance of the evolved SPs, the non-dominated SPs were applied to both the training and testing scenarios to compare with the 320 types of man-made SPs. The results reveal that the evolved SPs can discover more useful heuristics and behave more competitive than the man-made SPs in more complex scheduling scenarios. It also demonstrates that the evolved SPs have a strong generalization performance to be reused in new unobserved scheduling scenarios.</p></span></span></span></li>

The Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMAES) is activated at the beginning of the optimisation process as a preprocessing component for a limited budget. Subsequently, the produced solution is fed to the other two single-solution search algorithms. The first performs moves along the axes while the second makes use of a matrix orthogonalization to perform diagonal moves.

Four coordination strategies, in the fashion of hyperheuristics, have been used to coordinate the two single-solution algorithms. One of them is a simple randomized criterion while the other three are based on a success based reward mechanism. The four implementations of the hyperSPAM framework have been tested and compared against each other and modern metaheuristics on an extensive set of problems including theoretical functions and real-world engineering problems.

Numerical results show that the different versions of the framework display broadly a similar performance. One of the reward schemes appears to be marginally better than the others. The simplistic random coordination also displays a very good performance. All the implementations of hyperSPAM significantly outperform the other algorithms used for comparison.</p></span></span></span></li>

The OAS problem gives the flexibility to accept or reject an order where the systems have limited production capacity and on-time delivery constraints. The OAS problem, which is a typical   NPNP -hard problem, becomes more complex when a sequence-dependent setup time is incurred between two consecutive orders. Solving an NP-hard problem through exact approaches is computationally expensive and they fail to solve large-size instances. Therefore, we proposed hyper-heuristic in which artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is employed as a search methodology for the OAS problem. Hyper-heuristic works on the search space of heuristics, whereas ABC algorithm works on the solution space of the problem. A guided heuristic, which works on search space of heuristics, is developed to search the best heuristic from a set of heuristics residing at the lower level of hyper-heuristic. The proposed approach is compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. The computational results show that the integration of ABC algorithm into hyper-heuristic outperformed the other approaches in terms of average and minimum deviation from the upper bound.</p></span></span></span></li>

The JSPNW is an extension of well-known job-shop scheduling problem subject to the constraint that no waiting time is allowed between operations for a given job. This problem is a typical NP-hard problem. The hyper-heuristic algorithm comprises of two level frameworks. In the high-level, an evolutionary algorithm is employed to explore the search space. The low-level, which is comprised of generic as well as problem-specific heuristics such as guided mutation, multi-insert points and multi-swap. EA/G is a recent addition to the class of evolutionary algorithm that can be considered as a hybridization of genetic algorithms (GAs) and estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), and which tries to overcome the shortcomings of both. In GAs, the location information of the solutions found so far is directly used to generate offspring. On the other hand, EDAs use global statistical information to generate new offspring. In EDAs the global statistical information is stored in the form probability vector, and a new offspring is generated by sampling this probability vector. We have compared our approach with the state-of-the-art approaches. The computational results show the effectiveness of our approach.</p></span></span></span></li>

A hyper-heuristic algorithm is to gain an advantage of such process. In this paper, we present an evolutionary algorithm based hyper-heuristic framework for solving the set packing problem (SPP). The SPP is a typical   NPNP -hard problem. The hyper-heuristic is comprising of high level and low level. The higher level is mainly engaged in generating or constructing a heuristic. An evolutionary algorithm with guided mutation (EA/G) is employed at the high level. Whereas a set of problem-independent and problem-specific heuristics, called low level heuristics, are employed at the low level of hyper-heuristic. EA/G is recently added to the class of the evolutionary algorithms that try to utilize the complementary characteristics of genetic algorithms (GAs) and estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) to generate new offspring. In EA/G, the guided mutation operator generates an offspring by sampling the probability vector. The proposed approach is compared with the state-of-the-art approaches reported in the literature.

Cloud Computing has to work with the large number of tasks. The question arises, How to make appropriate decisions, while allocating hardware resources to the tasks and dispatching the computing tasks to resource pool that has become the challenging problem on cloud. In cloud environment task scheduling refers to an allocation of best suitable resources for the task which are executing with the consideration of different characteristics like makespan, time, cost, scalability, reliability, availability, resource utilization and other factors. We had tried to find the right method or sequence of heuristic in a given situation rather than trying to solve the problem directly. To check the importance of proposed algorithm we had compared it with the existing algorithms which had provided the far better results. We have introduced the improved hyper heuristic scheduling algorithm with the help of some efficient meta-heuristic algorithms, to find out the better task scheduling solutions for cloud computing systems and reduced the makespan time, and enhanced the utilization of cloud resources.</p></span></span></span></li>

Machine learning algorithms have been suggested as candidates for handling big data security problems. Among these algorithms, support vector machines (SVMs) have achieved remarkable success on various classification problems. However, to establish an effective SVM, the user needs to define the proper SVM configuration in advance, which is a challenging task that requires expert knowledge and a large amount of manual effort for trial and error. In this paper, we formulate the SVM configuration process as a bi-objective optimization problem in which accuracy and model complexity are considered as two conflicting objectives. We propose a novel hyper-heuristic framework for bi-objective optimization that is independent of the problem domain. This is the first time that a hyper-heuristic has been developed for this problem. The proposed hyper-heuristic framework consists of a high-level strategy and low-level heuristics. The high-level strategy uses the search performance to control the selection of which low-level heuristic should be used to generate a new SVM configuration. The low-level heuristics each use different rules to effectively explore the SVM configuration search space. To address bi-objective optimization, the proposed framework adaptively integrates the strengths of decomposition- and Pareto based approaches to approximate the Pareto set of SVM configurations. The effectiveness of the proposed framework has been evaluated on two cyber security problems: Microsoft malware big data classification and anomaly intrusion detection. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed framework is very effective, if not superior, compared with its counterparts and other algorithms.</p></span></span></span></li>

This problem has the potential to address a variety of problems as it is a general problem that can change its characteristics according to the combination of parameter values. In fact, k-IMDMTSP can become an altogether different problem depending on the choice of its parameter values. According to the No Free Lunch Theorem, it is not possible to have a general algorithm that can outperform all algorithms across all problems emanating from k-IMDMTSP due to various parameter values. However, an appropriate combination of different algorithms can successfully deal with all such problems emanating from k-IMDMTSP. Here, we have made an attempt in this direction with the help of hyper-heuristics. A hyper-heuristic based artificial bee colony algorithm is proposed for k-IMDMTSP. A new solution encoding scheme is proposed for representing a k-IMDMTSP solution within the proposed approach, and its associated search space is analyzed theoretically. It has been proved that our encoding scheme yields a search space that is considerably smaller in comparison to encoding schemes used previously. Experimental results on standard benchmark instances show that the proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches available in literature in terms of both solution quality and running time.</p></span></span></span></li>

John, <i>IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation</i>, IEEE, 2018 [<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8231198/"  target="_blank">PDF</a>] <span class="tooltip-wrap">[<font color="red">ABSTRACT</font>]<span class="tooltip-content"><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #CCCCCC">Metaheuristics, being tailored to each particular domain by experts, have been successfully applied to many computationally hard optimisation problems. However, once implemented, their application to a new problem domain or a slight change in the problem description would often require additional expert intervention. There is a growing number of studies on reusable cross-domain search methodologies, such as, selection hyper-heuristics, which are applicable to problem instances from various domains, requiring minimal expert intervention or even none. This study introduces a new learning automata based selection hyper-heuristic controlling a set of multiobjective metaheuristics. The approach operates above three well-known multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and mixes them, exploiting the strengths of each algorithm. The performance and behaviour of two variants of the proposed selection hyper-heuristic, each utilising a different initialisation scheme are investigated across a range of unconstrained multiobjective mathematical benchmark functions from two different sets and the real-world problem of vehicle crashworthiness. The empirical results illustrate the effectiveness of our approach for cross-domain search, regardless of the initialisation scheme, on those problems when compared to each individual multiobjective algorithm. Moreover, both variants perform signicantly better than some previously proposed selection hyper-heuristics for multiobjective optimisation, thus signicantly enhancing the opportunities for improved multiobjective optimisation.</p></span></span></span></li>

In this study we formulate a reinforcement learning hyper-heuristic scheme, and propose four low-level heuristics which can work coherently with the single point search algorithm MOSA/R (Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing Algorithm based on Re-seed) towards multi-objective optimization problems of general applications. Making use of the domination amount, crowding distance and hypervolume calculations, the proposed hyper-heuristic scheme can meet various optimization requirements adaptively and autonomously. The approach developed not only exhibits improved and more robust performance compared to AMOSA, NSGA-II and MOEA/D when applied to benchmark test cases, but also shows promising results when applied to a generic structural fault identification problem.

In this paper, we use genetic programming to automatically generate mutation operators for an evolutionary programming system, testing the proposed approach over a set of function classes, which represent a source of functions. The empirical results over a set of benchmark function classes illustrate that genetic programming can evolve mutation operators which generalise well from the training set to the test set on each function class. The proposed method is able to outperform existing human designed mutation operators with statistical significance in most cases, with competitive results observed for the rest.</p></span></span></span></li>

Cost optimisation of SWFS benefits cloud service consumers and providers by reducing temporal and monetary costs in processing SWFAs. However, cost optimisation performance of SWFS approaches is affected by the inherent nature of the SWFA as well as various types of scenarios that depend on the number of available virtual machines and varied sizes of SWFA datasets. Cost optimisation performance of existing SWFS approaches is still not satisfactory for all considered scenarios. Thus, there is a need to propose a dynamic hyper-heuristic approach that can effectively optimise the cost of SWFS for all different scenarios. This can be done by employing different meta-heuristic algorithms in order to utilise their strengths for each scenario. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to propose a Completion Time Driven Hyper-Heuristic (CTDHH) approach for cost optimisation of SWFS in a cloud environment. The CTDHH approach employs four well-known population-based meta-heuristic algorithms, which act as Low Level Heuristic (LLH) algorithms. In addition, the CTDHH approach enhances the native random selection way of existing hyper-heuristic approaches by incorporating the best computed workflow completion time to act as a high-level selector to dynamically pick a suitable algorithm from the pool of LLH algorithms after each run. A real-world cloud based experimentation environment has been considered to evaluate the performance of the proposed CTDHH approach by comparing it with five baseline approaches, i.e. four population-based approaches and an existing hyper-heuristic approach named Hyper-Heuristic Scheduling Algorithm (HHSA). Several different scenarios have also been considered to evaluate data-intensiveness and computation-intensive performance. Based on the results of the experimental comparison, the proposed approach has proven to yield the most effective performance results for all considered experimental scenarios.</p></span></span></span></li>

In a long planning horizon of multiple shifts, transport tasks are completed satisfying the time constraints. Due to the different travel distances and time of tasks, there are two types of shifts (long shift and short shift) in this problem. The unit driver cost for long shifts is higher than that of short shifts. A mathematical model of this Mixed-Shift Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (MS-VRPTW) is established in this paper, with two objectives of minimizing the total driver payment and the total travel distance. Due to the large scale and nonlinear constraints, the exact search showed is not suitable to MS-VRPTW. An initial solution construction heuristic (EBIH) and a selective perturbation Hyper-Heuristic (GIHH) are thus developed. In GIHH, five heuristics with different extents of perturbation at the low level are adaptively selected by a high level selection scheme with the Hill Climbing acceptance criterion. Two guidance indicators are devised at the high level to adaptively adjust the selection of the low level heuristics for this bi-objective problem. The two indicators estimate the objective value improvement and the improvement direction over the Pareto Front, respectively. To evaluate the generality of the proposed algorithms, a set of benchmark instances with various features is extracted from real-life historical datasets. The experiment results show that GIHH significantly improves the quality of the final Pareto Solution Set, outperforming the state-of-the-art algorithms for similar problems. Its application on VRPTW also obtains promising results.</p></span></span></span></li>

We find that the hyper-heuristics are particularly effective. For example, the hyper-heuristic genetic algorithm significantly outperformed the other six approaches (and with high effect size) for solution quality 85% of the time, and was also faster than all others 70% of the time.

The resulting sequences of low level heuristic selections and objective function values are used to generate a database of heuristic selections. The sequences in the database are broken down into subsequences and the mathematical concept of a logarithmic return is used to discriminate between "effective" subsequences, which tend to decrease the objective value, and "disruptive" subsequences, which tend to increase the objective value. These subsequences are then employed in a sequenced based hyper-heuristic and evaluated on an unseen set of benchmark problems. Empirical results demonstrate that the "effective" subsequences perform significantly better than the "disruptive" subsequences across a number of problem domains with 99% confidence. The identification of subsequences of heuristic selections that can be shown to be effective across a number of problems or problem domains could have important implications for the design of future sequence based hyper-heuristics.</p></span></span></span></li>

Ensemble GP-HH approaches have been shown to be more robust than existing GP-HH approaches that evolve single dispatching rules for dynamic JSS problems. For ensemble learning in classification, the design of how the members of the ensembles interact with each other, e.g., through various combination schemes, is important for developing effective ensembles for specific problems. In this paper, we investigate and carry out systematic analysis for four popular combination schemes. They are majority voting, which has been applied to dynamic JSS, followed by linear combination, weighted majority voting and weighted linear combination, which have not been applied to dynamic JSS. In addition, we propose several measures for analysing the decision making process in the ensembles evolved by GP. The results show that linear combination is generally better for the dynamic JSS problem than the other combination schemes investigated. In addition, the different combination schemes result in significantly different interactions between the members of the ensembles. Finally, the analysis based on the measures shows that the behaviours of the evolved ensembles are significantly affected by the combination schemes. Weighted majority voting has bias towards single members of the ensembles.</p></span></span></span></li>

A traditional hyper-heuristic model achieves this through a high-level heuristic that consists of two key components, namely a heuristic selection method and a move acceptance method. The effectiveness of the high-level heuristic is highly problem dependent due to the landscape properties of different problems. Most of the current hyper-heuristic models formulate a high-level heuristic by matching different combinations of components manually. This article proposes a method to automatically design the high-level heuristic of a hyper-heuristic model by utilizing a reinforcement learning technique. More specifically, Q-learning is applied to guide the hyper-heuristic model in selecting the proper components during different stages of the optimization process. The proposed method is evaluated comprehensively using benchmark instances from six problem domains in the Hyper-heuristic Flexible Framework. The experimental results show that the proposed method is comparable with most of the top-performing hyper-heuristic models in the current literature.</p></span></span></span></li>

A wide variety of search methodologies and algorithms have been proposed to optimize test case execution sequences, namely, search-based TCP. However, different algorithms perform differently and have different implementation costs and specific situations where an algorithm usually performs with high effectiveness and efficiency. When facing a new testing scenario, it is actually difficult to decide which algorithm is suitable. In this paper, to address the algorithm selection problem for different test scenarios, a more generally applicable algorithm based on a hyperheuristic strategy is proposed for search-based TCP. This includes a range of multiobjective algorithms with a variety of crossover strategies and a learning agent strategy to evaluate and select the appropriate algorithm execution sequence dynamically for different scenarios. The concrete hyperheuristic framework for multiobjective TCP is presented with an algorithm's repository in the low level and the learning agent strategy in the higher level. Experiments show that the proposed learning agent strategy can accurately evaluate algorithms in multiobjective problems and select the appropriate algorithm in each iteration.</p></span></span></span></li>

Several outstanding metaheuristic algorithms were proposed to solve dynamic optimization problems (DOPs) in the past decade. However, most of the effort is devoted to real-valued DOPs. Although, great majority of real-life problems has discrete and binary spaces, research in binary DOPs is still lacking. Accordingly, the present study introduces the first binary DOP application of Weighted Superposition Attraction Algorithm (WSA), which is a new generation swarm intelligence-based metaheuristic algorithm. As a distinctive feature from the existing literature, the introduced binary version of WSA (bWSA) does not require transfer functions for converting floating numbers to binary, whereas they are commonly employed in binary modifications of various metaheuristic algorithms. Additionally, some new extensions of bWSA are also developed in the present study. For comparative analysis, first, some state-of-the-art algorithms including Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithm are adopted. As secondarily, another new-generation hot optimizer, namely, Firefly Algorithm (FA), which has already been shown to be quite promising in DOPs, is employed in the present work. Moreover, all algorithms implemented here are enhanced by using dualism-based search, triggered random immigrants and adaptive hill climbing strategies. Dynamic modifications of the well-known binary benchmarking problems such as One-Max, Plateau, Royal Road and Deceptive Functions are used in the computational study. Performances of the proposed algorithms are compared in detail. Finally, non-parametric statistical tests are employed to validate the results. Findings point out superiority of bWSA in binary DOPs.</p></span></span></span></li>

On the other hand, there have been almost no attempts to build a hyper-heuristic to evolve an algorithm for solving real-valued optimization problems. In our previous research, we succeeded to evolve a NelderMead-like real function minimization heuristic using genetic programming and the primitives extracted from the original NelderMead algorithm. The resulting heuristic was better than the original NelderMead method in the number of solved test problems but it was slower in that it needed considerably more cost function evaluations to solve the problems also solved by the original method. In this paper we exploit grammatical evolution as a hyper-heuristic to evolve heuristics that outperform the original NelderMead method in all aspects. However, the main goal of the paper is not to build yet another real function optimization algorithm but to shed some light on the influence of different factors on the behavior of the evolution process as well as on the quality of the obtained heuristics. In particular, we investigate through extensive evolution runs the influence of the shape and dimensionality of the training function, and the impact of the size limit set to the evolving algorithms. At the end of this research we succeeded to evolve a number of heuristics that solved more test problems and in fewer cost function evaluations than the original NelderMead method. Our solvers are also highly competitive with the improvements made to the original method based on rigorous mathematical convergence proofs found in the literature. Even more importantly, we identified some directions in which to continue the work in order to be able to construct a productive hyper-heuristic capable of evolving real function optimization heuristics that would outperform a human designer in all aspects.</p></span></span></span></li>

In other words, the best training sample subset is chosen with the goal of enhancing the performance of classifier when confronting imbalanced data. To do so, some local search algorithms and a choice function are incorporated with a global search algorithm to improve its effectiveness. The global search used in this paper is binary quantum inspired gravitational search algorithm (BQIGSA) which is a recently proposed meta-heuristic search for optimization of binary encoded problems. Experiments are performed on 75 imbalanced data sets, and G-mean and AUC measures are employed for evaluation.

A two-layered system of decision-making algorithms is developed: a low-level specific solution-focused set of algorithms based on various machine learning paradigms, and a high-level hyper-heuristic which selects between them. This paper focuses on the lower level of this decision-making system, and details some of the approaches to task sequencing to be offered for selection, primarily based on differential evolution and k-means clustering, along with factoring in the effects of water currents and wind.

The aim of this research was to develop novel algorithms for obtaining an efficient marker that would achieve competitive results and optimize the garment production in terms of improving the utilization of textile material. In this research, a novel Grid heuristic was introduced for obtaining a marker, alongside its improvement methods: Grid-BLP and Grid-Shaking. These heuristics were hybridized with genetic algorithm that determined the placement order of cutting parts using the newly introduced All Equal First (AEF) placement order. A novel individual representation for genetic algorithm was designed that was composed of order sequence, rotation detection and the choice of placement algorithm (hyperheuristic). Experiments were conducted to determine the best marker making method, and hyper-heuristic efficiency. The implementation and experiments were conducted in MATLAB using GEATbx toolbox on five datasets from the garment industry: ALBANO, DAGLI, MAO, MARQUES and MAN SHIRT. Marker efficiency in percentage was recorded with best results: 84.50%, 80.13%, 79.54%, 84.67% and 86.02% obtained for the datasets respectively. The most efficient heuristic was Grid-Shaking. Hyper-heuristic applied Grid-Shaking in 88% of times. The created algorithm is independent of cutting parts shape. It can produce markers of arbitrary shape and is flexible in terms of expansion to new instances from the garment industry (leather nesting, avoiding damaged areas of material, marker making with materials with patterns)</p></span></span></span></li>

Operating at a level of abstraction above that of a metaheuristic, it can be seen as an algorithm that tries to find an appropriate solution method at a given decision point rather than a solution. This paper introduces a new hyper-heuristic that combines elements from reinforcement learning and tabu search. It is applied to solve two complex stochastic scheduling problems arising in mining, namely the stochastic open-pit mine production scheduling problem with one processing stream (SMPS) and one of its generalizations, SMPS with multiple processing streams and stockpiles (SMPS+). The performance of the new hyper-heuristic is assessed by comparing it to several solution methods from the literature: problem-specific algorithms tailored for the two problems addressed in the paper and general hyper-heuristics, which use only limited problem-specific information. The computational results indicate that not only is the proposed new hyper-heuristic approach superior to the other hyper-heuristics, but it also provides results that are comparable to or improve on the results obtained by the state-of-the-art problem-specific methods.</p></span></span></span></li>

Rescheduling is necessary for the steel manufacturing system. In the background of the increasing scale of scheduling and the numerous kinds of disturbance, the different algorithms are designed for different rescheduling problems, which will greatly increase the workload of the scheduling. In this paper, the disturbances are classified as strong disturbance and weak disturbance, and a rescheduling driven rule of strong disturbance is designed. Especially, the various disturbances impact on the production plan could be reflected in a time change, so a rescheduling model under time strong disturbance is established. In this paper, a hyper-heuristic genetic algorithm (HHGA) is designed based on the heuristic rules and genetic algorithms. This combination is intended to reduce the generation time of rescheduling plan under the strong disturbance. In the end, the simulation results indicate the success with the HHGA.</p></span></span></span></li>

Recent research for the LeadingOnes benchmark function has shown that the standard Simple Random, Permutation, Random Gradient, Greedy and Reinforcement Learning selection mechanisms show no effects of learning. The idea behind the learning mechanisms is to continue to exploit the currently selected heuristic as long as it is successful. However, the probability that a promising heuristic is successful in the next step is relatively low when perturbing a reasonable solution to a combinatorial optimisation problem. In this paper we generalise the simple selection-perturbation mechanisms so success can be measured over some fixed period of time tau, rather than in a single iteration. We present a benchmark function where it is necessary to learn to exploit a particular low-level heuristic, rigorously proving that it makes the difference between an efficient and an inefficient algorithm. For LeadingOnes we prove that the Generalised Random Gradient, and the Generalised Greedy Gradient hyper-heuristics achieve optimal performance, while Generalised Greedy, although not as fast, still outperforms Random Local Search. The performance of the former two hyper-heuristics improves as the number of operators to choose from increases, while that of the Generalised Greedy hyper-heuristic does not. Experimental analyses confirm these results for realistic problem sizes and shed some light on the best choices of the parameter tau in various situations.</p></span></span></span></li>

A brief discussion about the implementation process in addition to the decisions that had to be made during the implementation is presented. The framework implements an action selection model that operates on the perturbation stage of the Iterated Local Search algorithm to adaptively select among various low-level perturbation heuristics. The performance and efficiency of the developed framework is evaluated across six well-known real-world problem domains.</p></span></span></span></li>

It uses visible light communication technology where the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are deployed on the ceiling of the room and the receiver is kept mobile at a certain height from the ground level. This paper focuses on the optimal deployment of the LEDs with an objective to achieve the requisite level of communication performance without any transmission error while maintaining ubiquitous receiver mobility. The hyperheuristic evolutionary algorithm (HypEA) has been implemented to analyze and optimize the energy consumption through optimal placement of LEDs under variation of semiangle values. Furthermore, the implemented optimization algorithm investigates the other system related parameters including average outage area ratio, signal-to-noise ratio, and root mean square delay for a given threshold average bit error ratio. Finally, The obtained results are illustrated through numerical plots, which reveal that the HypEA is efficient in optimizing the system to minimize the overall power consumption under maximum receiver mobility.</p></span></span></span></li>

Unfortunately, it is often the case that new metaheuristic techniques are presented and assessed in a reduced set of cases, mostly due to the lack of computational resources to undertake extensive performance studies over a sufficiently diverse set of optimization benchmarks. This manuscript explores how ephemeral environments could be exploited to efficiently construct metaheuristic algorithms by virtue of a collaborative, distributed nature-inspired hyperheuristic framework specifically designed to be deployed over unreliable, uncoordinated computation nodes. To this end, the designed framework defines two types of nodes (trackers and peers, similarly to peer-to-peer networks), both reacting resiliently to unexpected disconnections of nodes disregarding their type. Peer nodes exchange their populations (i.e. constructed algorithms) asynchronously, so that local optima are avoided at every peer thanks to the contribution by other nodes. Furthermore, the overall platform is fully scalable, allowing its users to implement and share newly derived operators and fitness functions so as to enrich the diversity and universality of the heuristic algorithms found by the framework. Results obtained from in-lab experiments with a reduced number of nodes are discussed to shed light on the evolution of the best solution of the framework with the number of connected peers and the tolerance of the network to node disconnections.</p></span></span></span></li>

A multiobjective hyperheuristic called the AMALGAM method (an evolutionary-based technique incorporating multiple sub-algorithms simultaneously) is compared to three previously-studied metaheuristics, namely the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II, the Pareto ant colony optimisation algorithm and the multiobjective optimisation using cross-entropy method, in an attempt to improve upon the level of generality at which MICFMO may be conducted. This solution approach was motivated by a lack of consistent performance by the aforementioned metaheuristics when applied in isolation. Comparisons are conducted in the context of a test suite of several problem instances based on the SAFARI-1 nuclear research reactor. Nonparametric statistical analyses in respect of the optimisation results reveal that the AMALGAM method significantly outperforms the three metaheuristics in the majority of problem instances within the test suite. Additional comparisons are also performed between the proposed AMALGAM method and a randomised (or no-learning) version thereof, as well as a selection choice function-based multiobjective hyperheuristic available in the literature. It is found that the proposed method is superior to the choice function-based algorithm within the context of the MICFMO test suite, and yields results of similar quality when compared to its randomised version. The practical relevance of the hyperheuristic results is further demonstrated by comparing the solutions thus obtained to a reload configuration designed according to the current fuel assembly reload design approach followed at the SAFARI-1 reactor.</p></span></span></span></li>

Most businesses rely on priority rules to determine the order in which the activities required for the project should be executed. However, the design of such rules is non-trivial. Even with significant knowledge and experience, human experts are understandably limited in terms of the possibilities they can consider. This paper introduces a genetic programming based hyper-heuristic (GPHH) for producing efficient priority rules targeting the resource constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP). For performance analysis of the proposed approach, a series of experiments are conducted on the standard PSPLib instances with up to 120 activities. The evolved priority rules are then compared against the existing state-of-the-art priority rules to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The experimental results indicate that our GPHH is capable of producing reusable priority rules which significantly out-perform the best human designed priority rules.</p></span></span></span></li>

However, they only consider a single metric such as distance, time, or other costs, while ignoring a critical criterion: safety. In a smart city, people may prefer to find a safe walking route to avoid the potential crime risk as well as obtain a short distance. This problem can be specified as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP). Many methods were proposed in the past to solve the multi-objective route planning, the multi-objective evolutionary approach (MOEA) is considered as the most popular one. However, MOEA is non-optimized when used in a large-scale road network and becomes computationally expensive when handling a large population size. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective hyper-heuristic (MOHH) framework for walking route planning in a smart city. In the search framework, we design a set of low level heuristics to generate new routes. Moreover, we adopt reinforcement learning mechanism to select good low-level heuristics to accelerate searching speed. We further improve the reinforcement learning-based multi-objective hyper-heuristic (RL-MOHH) algorithm and implement a parallel version (RL-PMOHH) on general purpose graphic process unit. Extensive experiments are conducted on the safety-index map constructed from the historical urban data of the New York city. Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed RL-PMOHH is almost 173, 5.3, and 3.1 times faster than the exact multi-objective optimization algorithm, the RL-MOHH algorithm, and the parallel NSGA-II algorithm, respectively. Moreover, both RL-MOHH and RL-PMOHH can obtain more than 80% Pareto optimal solutions in a large-scale road network.</p></span></span></span></li>

Besides, a specialized learning mechanism for information exchange was defined in order to speed up the search process. Moreover, the algorithm was implemented in parallel so as to allow several metaheuristics to run simultaneously, thus achieving a significant reduction of time overhead. In the algorithmic design, realistic scenarios were employed so as to appraise the impact of each agent on optimization efficiency. The cases correspond to real-world offshore infrastructures to be located in the Argentinian marine platform. They were also analyzed to illustrate the validity and suitability of the proposed approach.

However, disassembly sequence planning (DSP) is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem due to complex constraints of many products. This paper considers partial and parallel disassembly sequence planning for solving the degrees-of-freedom in modular product design, considering disassembly time, cost, and energy consumption. An automatic self-decomposed disassembly precedence matrix (DPM) is designed to generate partial/parallel disassembly sequence for reducing complexity and improving efficiency. A Tabu search-based hyper heuristic algorithm with exponentially decreasing diversity management strategy is proposed. Compared with the low-level heuristics, the proposed algorithm is more efficient in terms of exploration ability and improving energy benefits (EBs). The comparison results of three different disassembly strategies prove that the partial/parallel disassembly has a great advantage in reducing disassembly time, and improving EBs and disassembly profit (DP).</p></span></span></span></li>

The RLCLRPRCC aims at reducing the logistics total cost and carbon emission and improving clients satisfactory by replacing the travel distance/time with fuel consumption and carbon emission costs under considering heterogeneous fleet, simultaneous pickup and delivery, and hard time windows. Aiming at this project, a novel approach is proposed: hyperheuristic (HH), which manipulates the space, consisted of a fixed pool of simple operators such as "shift" and "swap" for directly modifying the space of solutions. In proposed framework of HH, a kind of shared mechanism-based self-adaptive selection strategy and self-adaptive acceptance criterion are developed to improve its performance, accelerate convergence, and improve algorithm accuracy. The results show that the proposed HH effectively solves LRP/LRPSPD/RLCLRPRCC within reasonable computing time and the proposed mathematical model can reduce 2.6% logistics total cost, 27.6% carbon emission/fuel consumption, and 13.6% travel distance. Additionally, several managerial insights are presented for logistics enterprises to plan and design the distribution network by extensively analyzing the effects of various problem parameters such as depot cost and location, clients distribution, heterogeneous vehicles, and time windows allowance, on the key performance indicators, including fuel consumption, carbon emissions, operational costs, travel distance, and time.</p></span></span></span></li>

The effectiveness of these algorithms towards solving difficult problems has attracted researchers and practitioners. As a result, numerous type of this algorithm have been proposed. However, there is a heavy critics that some of these algorithms lack novelty. In fact, some of these algorithms are the same in terms of the updating operators but with different mimicking scenarios and names. The performance of a metaheuristic algorithm depends on how it balance the degree of the two basic search mechanisms, namely intensification and diversification. Hence, introducing novel algorithms which contributes to a new way of search mechanism is welcome but not for a mere repetition of the same algorithm with the same or perturbed operators but different metaphor. With this regard, it is ideal to have a framework where different custom made operators are used along with existing or new operators. Hence, this paper presents a swarm hyperheuristic framework, where updating operators are taken as low level heuristics and guided by a high level hyperheuristic. Different learning approaches are also proposed to guide the intensification and diversification search behaviour of the algorithm. Hence, a swarm hyperheuristic without learning (SSH1), with offline learning (SSH2)  and with an online learning (SSH3) is proposed and discussed. A simulation based comparison and discussion is also presented using a set of nine updating operators with selected metaheuristic algorithms based on twenty benchmark problems. The problems are selected from both unconstrained and constrained optimization problems with their dimension ranging from two to fifty. The simulation results show that the proposed approach with learning has a better performance in general.</p></span></span></span></li>

Container-based clouds support flexible deployment of applications and therefore brings the potential to reduce the energy consumption of data centers. With the goal of energy reduction, it is more difficult to optimize the allocation of containers than traditional VM-based clouds because of the finer granularity of resources. Little research has been conducted for applying human-design heuristics on balanced and unbalanced resources. In this paper, we first compare three human-design heuristics and show they cannot handle balanced and unbalanced resources scenarios well. We propose a learning-based algorithm: genetic programming hyper-heuristic (GPHH) to automatically generate a suitable heuristic for allocating containers in an online fashion. The results show that the proposed GPHH managed to evolve better heuristics than the human-designed ones in terms of energy consumption in a range of cloud scenarios.</p></span></span></span></li>

But such data aggregation is recognized to be highly susceptible to clone attacks owing to the unattended nature of the network. Thus, ascertaining trustiness of the sensor nodes is crucial for WSN. Though numerous methods for cloned attack node isolation are provided in recent years, energy efficiency is the most significant issues to be handled. In this work, a Residual Energy and GSA based Simulated Annealing (RE-GSASA) for detecting and isolating the cloned attack node in WSN is given. Residual Energy-based Data Aggregation in WSN initially uses residual energy because the basis to perform aggregation technique with the sensor node possessing the maximum residual energy as the Cluster Head (CH). Next, Location-based Cloned attack on cluster nodes is given to enhance the clone detection probability rate. Here, the location and residual energy is taken into account to identify the presence of cloned attack nodes within the network. Finally, Gravitational Search Algorithm with global search ability is investigated to identify the cloned attack nodes and performs isolation through local optimal simulated annealing model.

Each MOEA uses different algorithmic components during the search process and performs differently. Therefore, there is no single algorithm able to achieve the best results in all problems. The collaboration of multiple MOEAs and the use of hyperheuristics can help to create a searchability able to achieve good results in a wide range of problem instances. In this context, this research proposes a model for collaboration of MOEAs guided by hyper-heuristic, called HHcMOEA. In HHcMOEA, the hyper-heuristic controls and mix MOEAs, automatically deciding which one to apply during the search process. On the other hand, HHcMOEA also incorporates exchange of information between the MOEAs. And, a fitness improvement rate metric, based on the R2 indicator to decide about the quality of the application of an MOEA. HHcMOEA is implemented using a set of MOEAs with diverse characteristics. An experiment is used to evaluate HHcMOEA in two versions: with and without information exchange. Although, the two versions of HHcMOEA are compared to the MOEAs applied alone. The empirical evaluation used a set of benchmark problems with different properties. The proposed model achieved the best result or equivalent to the best in almost all problems.

Despite their success, there are only few hyper-heuristics developed for many-objective optimization. Our approach, namely MOEA/D-LinUCB, combines the MOEA/D framework with a new selection hyper-heuristic to solve many-objective problems. It uses an innovative Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) to determine the low level heuristic (Differential Evolution mutation strategy) that should be applied to each individual during MOEA/D execution. The main advantage of using Contextual MAB is to include information about the current search state into the selection procedure. We tested MOEA/D-LinUCB on a well established set of 9 instances from the WFG benchmark for a number of objectives varying from 3 to 20. The IGD indicator and Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn-Sidak's statistical tests are applied to evaluate the algorithm performance. Four variants of the proposed algorithm are compared with each other to define a proper configuration. A properly configured MOEA/D-LinUCB is then compared with MOEA/D-FRRMAB and MOEAID-DRA-two well-known MOEA/D-based algorithms. Results show that MOEA/D-LinUCB performs well, particularly when the number of objectives is 10 or greater. Therefore, MOEA/D-LinUCB can be considered as a promising many-objective Hyper-Heuristic.</p></span></span></span></li>

IB-MOEAs are normally based on the use of a single performance indicator. However, the effect of the combination of multiple performance indicators for selecting solutions is a topic that has rarely been explored. In this paper, we propose a hyper-heuristic which combines the strengths and compensates for the weaknesses of four density estimators based on R2, IGD+, ?+ and ?p. The selection of the indicator to be used at a particular moment during the search is done using online learning and a Markov chain. Additionally, we propose a novel framework that aims to reduce the computational cost involved in the calculation of the indicator contributions. Our experimental results indicate that our proposed approach can outperform state-of-the-art MOEAs based on decomposition (MOEA/D) reference points (NSGA-III) and the R2 indicator (R2-EMOA) for problems with both few and many objectives.</p></span></span></span></li>

Hyper-heuristic search has traditionally been divided into two layers: a lower problem-domain layer (where domain-specific heuristics are applied) and an upper hyper-heuristic layer, where heuristics are selected or generated. The interface between the two layers is commonly termed the "domain barrier". Historically this interface has been defined to be highly restrictive, in the belief that this is required for generality. We argue that this prevailing conception of domain barrier is so limiting as to defeat the original motivation for hyper-heuristics. We show how it is possible to make use of domain knowledge without loss of generality and describe generalized hyper-heuristics which can incorporate arbitrary domain knowledge.</p></span></span></span></li>

In this regard, heuristic and hybrid of heuristic algorithms have been widely used to solve optimization problems because they have been provided efficient way to find an approximate solution but they are limited to use number of different heuristic algorithm and they are so problem-depend. Hyper-heuristic is a set of heuristics, meta- heuristics, and high-level search strategies that work on the heuristic search space instead of solution search space. Hyper-heuristics techniques have been employed to develop approaches that are more general than optimization search methods and traditional techniques. The aim of a hyperheuristic algorithms is to reduce the amount of domain knowledge by using the capabilities of high-level heuristics and the abilities of low-level heuristics simultaneously in the search strategies. In this study, an efficient robust hyperheuristic clustering algorithm is proposed to find the robust and optimum clustering results based on a set of easy-to-implement low-level heuristics. Several data sets are tested to appraise the performance of the suggested approach. Reported results illustrate that the suggested approach can provide acceptable results than the alternative methods.</p></span></span></span></li>

Given a UCARP instance, the GPHH evolves feasible solutions in the form of decision making policies which decide the next task to serve whenever a vehicle completes its current service. Existing GPHH approaches have two drawbacks. First, they tend to generate small routes by routing through the depot and refilling prior to the vehicle being fully loaded. This usually increases the total cost of the solution. Second, existing GPHH approaches cannot control the extra repair cost incurred by a route failure, which may result in higher total cost. To address these issues, this paper proposes a new GPHH algorithm with a new No-Early-Refill filter to prevent generating small routes, and a novel Flood Fill terminal to better handle route failures. Experimental studies show that the newly proposed GPHH algorithm significantly outperforms the existing GPHH approaches on the Ugdb and Uval benchmark datasets. Further analysis has verified the effectiveness of both the new filter and terminal.</p></span></span></span></li>

Simple heuristics often suffice in this case. However, for many domains, a simple heuristic may not be available, and designing one can require considerable expertise. Noting that a wide variety of problems can be represented as graphs, we describe a system for the automatic generation of constructive heuristics in the form of Python programs by mean of grammatical evolution. The system can be applied seamlessly to different graph-based problem domains, only requiring modification of the fitness function. We demonstrate its effectiveness by generating heuristics for the Travelling Salesman and Multi-Dimensional Knapsack problems. The system is shown to be better or comparable to human-designed heuristics in each domain. The generated heuristics can be used out-of-the-box to provide a solution, or to augment existing hyper-heuristic algorithms with new low-level heuristics.</p></span></span></span></li>

Its main feature is a mechanism to allocate different computational effort proportional to the difficult of each subproblem. Despite its success, MOEA/D-DRA has a large set of parameters and operators, whose selection could be a difficult task. This paper aims at improving the performance of MOEA/D-DRA by means of a hyper-heuristic using two parameter/operator selection phases: one off-line strongly based on Iterated Race Automatic Algorithm Configuration (Irace) and another one (online) based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) technique. The proposed approach is compared with the original MOEA/D-DRA, NSGAII and IBEA over 51 instances of 7 well known benchmarks (CEC 2009, GLT, LZ09, MOP, DTLZ, ZDT and WFG). Results show that Irace and UCB are interesting methods to support the hyper-heuristic functioning when selecting parameters/operators of MOEA/D-DRA in the addressed problems.</p></span></span></span></li>

A recent work proposed a general-purpose selection hyper-heuristic search framework with reusable components, designed for rapid development of grouping hyper-heuristics to solve grouping problems. The framework was tested only on the graph colouring problem domain. Extending the previous work, this study compares the performance of selection hyperheuristics implemented using the framework, pairing up various heuristic/operator selection and move acceptance methods for data clustering. The selection hyper-heuristic performs the search processing a single solution at any decision point and controls a fixed set of generic low level heuristics specifically designed for the grouping problems based on a biobjective formulation. An archive of high quality solutions, capturing the trade-off between the number of clusters and overall error of clustering, is maintained during the search process. The empirical results verify the effectiveness of a successful selection hyper-heuristic, winner of a recent hyper-heuristic challenge for data clustering on a set of benchmark problem instances.</p></span></span></span></li>

The computational requirements of VS models, along with the size of the databases, containing up to millions of biological macromolecular structures, propitiates the use of High-Performance Computing. METADOCK is a tool for the application of metaheuristics to VS in heterogeneous clusters of computers based on CPU and GPU. It facilitates the efficient application of several metaheuristics in parallel computational systems. HYPERDOCK represents a step forward; the exploration for satisfactory metaheuristics is systematically approached by means of hyperheuristics working on top of the metaheuristic schema of METADOCK. The parallelism of METADOCK is intrinsically exploited in HYPERDOCK, which also includes parallelism at its own level.

Specifically, we consider the stochastic visit duration, which may make preplanned trip infeasible. Existing studies focus on optimising robust solutions in advance, which is not effective in adjusting the subsequent trip in real time. Decision making policies, on the other hand, are effective heuristics to this end. However, it is very challenging to manually design effective policies. In this paper, we investigate automatically evolving policies for the stochastic team orienteering problem with time windows by genetic programming hyper-heuristics. We designed novel problem-specific features for the terminal set, and a meta-algorithm for fitness evaluation. Furthermore, we developed two look-ahead features that can provide more fruitful information than the basic features for real-time decision making. The experimental studies showed that the proposed genetic programming hyper-heuristic can evolve policies that are much better than the manually designed policies. In addition, it seems that the look-ahead features are not so effective when directly included in the terminals. This suggests the requirement of more intelligent ways of incorporating lookahead information.</p></span></span></span></li>

Instead local search methods are often effective to find near-optimal solutions quickly. However, it is difficult to determine which local search with what parameter setting should be optimal for a given problem. In this study two complex combinatorial optimisation are used, Multi-capacity Bin Packing Problems (MCBPP) and Google Machine Reassignment Problem (GMRP). Our experiments show that no single local search method could consistently achieve the best. They are sensitive to problem search space and parameters. Therefore we propose a hyper heuristic based method, which automatically selects the most appropriate local search during the search and tune the parameters accordingly. The results show that our proposed hyper-heuristic approach is effective and can achieve the overall best on multiple instances of both MCBPP and GMRP.</p></span></span></span></li>

However, controlling and coordinating a swarm of robots is challenging, because of the complexity and uncertainty of the environment where manual programming of robot behaviours is often impractical. In this study we propose a hyper-heuristic methodology for swarm robots. It allows robots to create suitable actions based on a set of low-level heuristics, where each heuristic is a behavioural element. With online learning, the robot behaviours can be improved during execution by autonomous heuristic adjustment. The proposed hyper-heuristic framework is applied to surface cleaning tasks on buildings where multiple separate surfaces exist and complete surface information is difficult to obtain. Under this scenario, the robot swarm not only needs to clean the surfaces efficiently by distributing the robots, but also to move across surfaces by self-assembling into a bridge structure. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of the hyper-heuristic framework; the same group of robots was able to autonomously deal with multiple surfaces of different layouts. Their behaviours can improve over time because of the online learning mechanism.</p></span></span></span></li>

Such selection is impacted by conflicting factors and has been efficiently solved by Evolutionary Multi-objective Algorithms in combination with hyper-heuristics. However, many times there is a cost budget or coverage level to be satisfied during the test, which are difficult to be incorporated as objective functions. Due to this, the choice of the best solution to be used in practice is not always easy. To deal with this situation, this paper introduces a preference-based hyper-heuristic approach to solve this problem. The approach implements the preference-based algorithm r-NSGA-II working with the random and FRRMAB selection methods. This last one uses a reward function based on r-dominance concept that takes into consideration a Reference Point provided by the tester. Our approach outperforms existing approaches, as well as the traditional algorithm r-NSGA-II, generating a reduced number of non-interesting solutions from the tester's point of view, that is, considering the provided Region of Interest (ROI).</p></span></span></span></li>

In this work, we present the use of CNN on classifying good quality images versus bad quality images without understanding the image content. The well known data-sets were used for performance evaluation. More importantly we propose a hyper-heuristic approach for tuning CNN hyper-parameters. The proposed hyper-heuristic encompasses of a high level strategy and various low level heuristics. The high level strategy utilises search performance to determine how to apply low level heuristics to automatically find an appropriate set of CNN hyper-parameters. Our experiments show the effectiveness of this hyper-heuristic approach which can achieve high accuracy even when the training size is significantly reduced and conventional CNNs can no longer perform well.

It is widely evidenced in the literature that JSS usually contains many (four or more) potentially conflicting objectives. One of the promising and successful approaches to solve the JSS problem is Genetic Programming Hyper-Heuristic (GP-HH). This approach automatically evolves dispatching rules for solving JSS problems. This paper aims to evolve a set of effective dispatching rules for many-objective JSS with genetic programming and NSGA-III. NSGA-III originally defines uniformly distributed reference points in the objective space. Thus, there will be few reference points with no Pareto optimal solutions associated with them; especially, in the cases with discrete and non-uniform Pareto front, resulting in many useless reference points during evolution. In other words, these useless reference points adversely affect the performance of NSGA-III and genetic programming. To address the above issue, in this paper a new reference point adaptation mechanism is proposed based on the distribution of the candidate solutions. We evaluated the performance of the proposed mechanism on many-objective benchmark JSS instances. Our results clearly show that the proposed strategy is promising in adapting reference points and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithms for many-objective JSSP.</p></span></span></span></li>

Thus, agent-based techniques seem suitable for the design of hyper-heuristics. In a previous work we proposed MOABHH [5], an agent-based hyper-heuristic framework for choosing the best multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). Our approach performs a cooperative voting procedure, considering a set of quality indicator voters, to define which MOEA should generate more new solutions during execution time. However, MOABHH was just applied to solve benchmark problems, without being tested in real-world problems. Thus, this paper evaluates MOABHH in four realworld multi-objective engineering problems. For this purpose, an additional MOEA and new quality indicators better adapted to real-world problems were used. The obtained results show that our strategy aways find solutions at least equals to the ones generated by the best algorithm, and sometimes even overcomes these results</p></span></span></span></li>

HH is thus categorized into four classifications, namely, selection perturbative / constructive, generation perturbative / constructive (see Chapters 3, 2, 5 and 4).

This thesis proposes a refined generic and parametrised infeasible local search (GPILS) algorithm for solving COPs and customises it to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP), for illustration purposes. In addition, a rule-based heuristic is proposed to initialise infeasible local search, referred to as the parameterised infeasible heuristic (PIH), which allows the analyst to have some control over the features of the infeasible solution he/she might want to start the infeasible search with. A recursive infeasible neighbourhood search (RINS) as well as a generic patching procedure to search the infeasible space are also proposed. These procedures are designed in a generic manner,  so they can be adapted to any choice of parameters of the GPILS, where the set of  parameters, in fact for simplicity, refers to set of parameters, components, criteria and rules.
Furthermore, a hyperheuristic framework is proposed for optimizing the parameters of  GPILS referred to as HH-GPILS. Experiments have been run for both sequential (i.e.  simulated annealing, variable neighbourhood search, and tabu search) and parallel  hyperheuristics (i.e., genetic algorithms / GAs) to empirically assess the performance  of the proposed HH-GPILS in solving TSP using instances from the TSPLIB. Empirical results suggest that HH-GPILS delivers an outstanding performance.  Finally, an offline learning mechanism is proposed as a seeding technique to improve  the performance and speed of the proposed parallel HH-GPILS. The proposed offline  learning mechanism makes use of a knowledge-base to keep track of the best  performing chromosomes and their scores. Empirical results suggest that this learning  mechanism is a promising technique to initialise the GAs population.</p></span></span></span></li>

The districting process aims to find a partition of the service region into delivery and collection zones that may be served by a single vehicle that departs from a central depot. Criteria to be optimized are to balance workload content among the districts and to create districts of compact shape. A solution approach based on a hybrid procedure that combines elements of GRASP and Tabu Search (TS) is proposed to solve large scale instances. Numerical experimentation is performed considering different instance sizes and types. Results show that the proposed solution approach is able to solve large scale instances in reasonable computational times with good quality of the solutions obtained. To determine the quality of the solutions, results are compared with CPLEX solutions and with the current real solution to highlight the benefits of the proposed approach.

Good solutions to operations research problems can make a large difference to the efficient running of businesses and organisations and so the field often searches for new methods to improve these solutions. The high school timetabling problem is an example of an operations research problem and is a challenging task which requires assigning events and resources to time slots subject to a set of constraints. In this paper a new sequence-based selection hyper-heuristic is presented that produces excellent results on a suite of high school timetabling problems. In this study, we present an easy-to-implement, easy-to-maintain and effective sequence-based selection hyper-heuristic to solve high school timetabling problems using a benchmark of unified real-world instances collected from different countries. We show that with sequence-based methods, it is possible to discover new best known solutions for a number of the problems in the timetabling domain. Through this investigation, the usefulness of sequence-based selection hyper-heuristics has been demonstrated and the capability of these methods has been shown to exceed the state-of-the-art.</p></span></span></span></li>

Specifically, the problem of Multilevel Capacitated Lot Sizing Problem with linked lot sizes (MLCLSP-L) is considered. The problem is a classical, practical and notoriously hard problem. We propose a new modeling technique for MLCLSP-L based on a GA-driven hyperheuristic, which enables modeling of some issues previously not modeled. Proposed model uses an indirect representation by allowing GA search through a space of low level heuristics. Each one of the low level heuristics is simple and determines the detailed production plan of a machine in a period. The solution is constructed through combination of these low level heuristics.

However, the use of such algorithms can be a hard task for the software engineer, mainly due to the significant range of parameter and algorithm choices. To help in this task, the use of Hyper-heuristics is recommended. Hyper-heuristics can select or generate low-level heuristics while optimization algorithms are executed, and thus can be generically applied. Despite their benefits, we find only a few works using hyper-heuristics in the SBSE field. Considering this fact, we describe HITO, a Hyper-heuristic for the Integration and Test Order Problem, to adaptively select search operators while MOEAs are executed using one of the selection methods: Choice Function and Multi-Armed Bandit. The experimental results show that HITO can outperform the traditional MOEAs NSGA-II and MOEA/DD. HITO is also a generic algorithm, since the user does not need to select crossover and mutation operators, nor adjust their parameters.</p></span></span></span></li>

As a result, it is necessary to develop a new approach to the entire maintenance scheduling process. In the largest region of Denmark, the Jutland peninsula, there is a decentralised structure for maintenance planning, whereby the crew start their duties from their home locations rather than starting from a single depot. In this paper, we allocate a set of maintenance tasks in Jutland to a set of maintenance crew members, defining the sub-region that each crew member is responsible for. Two key considerations must be made when allocating tasks to crew members. Firstly a fair balance of workload must exist between crew members and secondly, the distance between two tasks in the same sub-region must be minimised, in order to facilitate quick response in the case of unexpected failure. We propose a perturbative selection hyper-heuristic framework to improve initial solutions by reassigning outliers, those tasks that are far away, to another crew member at each iteration, using one of five low-level heuristics. Results of two hyper-heuristics, using a number of different initial solution construction methods are presented over a set of 12 benchmark problem instances.</p></span></span></span></li>

Many heuristics were proposed to deal with the two components of the problem separately. In this work, we investigate the use of automatic online heuristic selection in order to find the best combination of the different known heuristics. In order to achieve this, we propose a genetic programming based hyper-heuristic called GPHS*, and compare it to state-of-the-art algorithms.

Little attention has been devoted to this in the literature, and the decision is left at the discretion of the investigator. The performance of a hyper-heuristic depends on the quality and size of the heuristic pool. Using more than one heuristic is generally advantageous, however, an unnecessary large pool can decrease the performance of adaptive approaches. Our goal is to bring methodological rigour to this step. The proposed methodology uses non-parametric statistics and fitness landscape measurements from an available set of heuristics and benchmark instances, in order to produce a compact subset of effective heuristics for the underlying problem. We also propose a new iterated local search hyper-heuristic using multi-armed bandits coupled with a change detection mechanism. The methodology is tested on two real-world optimization problems: course timetabling and vehicle routing. The proposed hyper-heuristic with a compact heuristic pool, outperforms state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics and competes with problem-specific methods in course timetabling, even producing new best-known solutions in 5 out of the 24 studied instances.</p></span></span></span></li>

In this paper, we propose a new selection hyper-heuristic with the multilevel paradigm. The multilevel paradigm refers to the process of dividing large problems into sub-problems. Each sub-problem is being solved to reach an optimal solution by using the resulting solution from a previous level as a starting solution at the next level. The selection strategy chooses the adequate low-level heuristic at any iteration during the search. For analysis purposes, several variants of hyper-heuristics are implemented and Max-SAT is used as the test bed. The experimental results revealed that the multilevel paradigm together with a new hybrid-heuristic selection mechanism provides a substantial performance improvement. A comparison with two known state of the art algorithms that are GSAT and WALKSAT is given to further show the efficiency of our method.</p></span></span></span></li>

As such, the so-called low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) was presented to prolong the lifetime of a WSN. Although the original idea of LEACH is to keep each sensor in a WSN from being chosen as a cluster head (CH) too frequently so that the loading of the sensors will be balanced, thus avoiding particular sensors from running out of their energy quickly and particular regions from failing to work, it is far from perfect because LEACH may select an unsuitable set of sensors as the cluster heads. In this paper, a high-performance hyper-heuristic algorithm will be presented to enhance the clustering results of WSN called hyper-heuristic clustering algorithm (HHCA). The proposed algorithm is designed to reduce the energy consumption of a WSN, by using a high-performance metaheuristic algorithm to find a better solution to balance the residual energy of all the sensors so that the number of alive sensor nodes will be maximized. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, it is compared with LEACH, LEACH with genetic algorithm, and hyper-heuristic algorithm alone in this study. Experimental results show that HHCA is able to provide a better result than all the other clustering algorithms compared in this paper, in terms of the energy consumed.</p></span></span></span></li>

Although useful, meta-heuristic algorithms that make up these strategies often require specific domain knowledge in order to allow effective tuning before good quality solutions can be obtained. Hyper-heuristics provide an alternative methodology to meta-heuristics which permit adaptive selection and/or generation of meta-heuristics automatically during the search process. This paper describes our experience with four hyper-heuristic selection and acceptance mechanisms namely Exponential Monte Carlo with counter (EMCQ), Choice Function (CF), Improvement Selection Rules (ISR), and newly developed Fuzzy Inference Selection (FIS), using the t-way test generation problem as a case study.

These heuristics are usually used to create an initial solution to the problem which is improved using optimization techniques such as metaheuristics. For examination timetabling and university course timetabling problems essentially graph colouring heuristics have been used for this purpose. The process of deriving heuristics manually for educational timetabling is a time consuming task. Furthermore, according to the no free lunch theorem different heuristics will perform well for different problems and problem instances. Hence, automating the induction of construction heuristics will reduce the man hours involved in creating such heuristics, allow for the derivation of problem specific heuristics and possibly result in the derivation of heuristics that humans have not thought of. This paper presents generation construction hyper-heuristics for educational timetabling. The study investigates the automatic induction of two types of construction heuristics, namely, arithmetic heuristics and hierarchical heuristics. Genetic programming is used to evolve arithmetic heuristics. Genetic programming, genetic algorithms and the generation of random heuristic combinations is examined for the generation of hierarchical heuristics. The hyper-heuristics generating both types of heuristics are applied to the examination timetabling and the curriculum based university course timetabling problems. The evolved heuristics were found to perform much better than the existing graph colouring heuristics used for this domain. Furthermore, it was found that the while the arithmetic heuristics were more effective for the examination timetabling problem, the hierarchical heuristics produced better results than the arithmetic heuristics for the curriculum based course timetabling problem. Genetic algorithms proved to be the most effective at inducing hierarchical heuristics.</p></span></span></span></li>

Modularity optimization is an interesting and valuable approach for detection of network communities in complex networks. Due to characteristics of the problem dealt with in this study, the exact solution methods consume much more time. Therefore, we propose six metaheuristic optimization algorithms, which each contain a modularity optimization approach. These algorithms are the original Bat Algorithm (BA), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), modified Big Bang-Big Crunch algorithm (BB-BC), improved Bat Algorithm based on the Differential Evolutionary algorithm (BADE), effective Hyperheuristic Differential Search Algorithm (HDSA) and Scatter Search algorithm based on the Genetic Algorithm (SSGA). Four of these algorithms (HDSA, BADE, SSGA, BB-BC) contain new methods, whereas the remaining two algorithms (BA and GSA) use original methods. To clearly demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms when solving the problems, experimental studies were conducted using nine real-world complex networks - five of which are social networks and the rest of which are biological networks. The algorithms were compared in terms of statistical significance. According to the obtained test results, the HDSA proposed in this study is more efficient and competitive than the other algorithms that were tested.</p></span></span></span></li>

DSO is an artifact-inspired technique, as opposed to many nature-inspired algorithms used today. DSO is very flexible because it is not related to natural behaviors or phenomena. DSO has two core parts: the semiautonomous drones that fly over a landscape to explore, and the command center that processes the retrieved data and updates the drones' firmware whenever necessary. The self-adaptive aspect of DSO in this work is the perturbation/movement scheme, which is the procedure used to generate target coordinates. This procedure is evolved by the command center during the global optimization process in order to adapt DSO to the search landscape. We evaluated DSO on a set of widely employed single-objective benchmark functions. The statistical analysis of the results shows that the proposed method is competitive with the other methods, but we plan several future improvements to make it more powerful and robust.</p></span></span></span></li>

Generally, vehicles can be managed either centrally or decentrally. A common way to coordinate agents decentrally is to use the contract-net protocol (CNET) that uses auctions to allocate tasks among agents. To participate in an auction, agents require a method that estimates the value of a task. Typically, this method involves an optimization algorithm, e.g. to calculate the cost to insert a customer. Recently, hyper-heuristics have been proposed for automated design of heuristics. Two properties of automatically designed heuristics are particularly promising: (1) a generated heuristic computes quickly, it is expected therefore that hyper-heuristics perform especially well for urgent problems, and (2) by using simulation-based evaluation, hyper-heuristics can create a 'rule of thumb' that anticipates situations in the future. In the present paper we empirically evaluate whether hyper-heuristics, more specifically genetic programming (GP), can be used to improve agents decentrally coordinated via CNET. We compare several GP settings and compare the resulting heuristic with existing centralized and decentralized algorithms based on the OptaPlanner optimization library. The tests are conducted in real-time on a dynamic PDP dataset with varying levels of dynamism, urgency, and scale. The results indicate that the evolved heuristic always outperforms the optimization algorithm in the decentralized multi-agent system (MAS) and often outperforms the centralized optimization algorithm. Our paper demonstrates that designing MASs using genetic programming is an effective way to obtain competitive performance compared to traditional operational research approaches. These results strengthen the relevance of decentralized agent based approaches in dynamic logistics.</p></span></span></span></li>

Additionally, in comparison to evolutionary or population-based approaches, constructive search strategy, which is shown to be successful in stationary combinatorial optimization problems, is commonly ignored by the dynamic optimization community. In the present work, a constructive and multi-start search strategy is proposed to solve dynamic multi-dimensional knapsack problem, which has numerous applications in real world. Making use of constructive and multi-start features, the aim here is to test the performance of such a strategy and to observe its behavior in dynamically changing environments. In this regard, this strategy is compared to the well-known evolutionary and population-based approaches, including a Genetic Algorithm-based memetic algorithm, Differential Evolution algorithm, Firefly Algorithm and a hyper-heuristic, which employs these population-based algorithms as low-level heuristics in accordance with their individual contributions. Furthermore, in order to improve their performances in dynamic environments, the mentioned evolutionary algorithms are enhanced by using triggered random immigrants and adaptive hill climbing strategies. As one can see from the comprehensive experimental analysis, while the proposed approach outperforms most of the evolutionary-based approaches, it is outperformed by firefly and hyper-heuristic algorithms in some of the instances. This points out competiveness of the proposed approaches. Finally, according to the statistical results of non-parametric tests, one can conclude that the proposed approach can be considered as a promising and a competitive algorithm in dynamic environments.</p></span></span></span></li>

The approach consists of a multi-objective evolutionary learning process, using specific tailored genetic operators, to produce sets of variable length rules representing hyper-heuristics. Each hyper-heuristic builds a solution to a given problem instance by sensing the state of the instance, and deciding which single heuristic to apply at each decision point. The hyper-heuristics consider the minimization of two conflicting objectives when building a solution: the number of bins used to accommodate the pieces and the total time required to do the job. The proposed framework integrates three well-studied multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to produce sets of Pareto-approximated hyper-heuristics: the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II, the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2, and the Generalized Differential Evolution Algorithm 3. We conduct an extensive experimental analysis using a large set of 2D bin packing problem instances containing convex and non-convex irregular pieces, under many conditions, settings and using several performance metrics. The analysis assesses the robustness and flexibility of the proposed approach, providing encouraging results when compared against a set of well-known baseline single heuristics.</p></span></span></span></li>

This approach dynamically selects, based on the state of a given solution, the most promising operator (from a pool of operators) to continue the search process. The dynamic selection is usually based on the analysis of the latest applications of a given operator during actual execution, estimating the potential success of the operator at the current solution state. The estimation can be made by Evolvability Metrics. Calculating an Evolvability metric is computationally expensive since it requires the generation and evaluation of a neighborhood of solutions. This paper aims to estimate the potential success of an operator for a given solution state by using a pre-trained neural network; known as a parallel perceptron. The proposal accelerates the on-line selection process, allowing us to achieve better performance than hyper-heuristic models which directly use evolvability functions.</p></span></span></span></li>

This paper proposes to develop an expert system to allocate resources in cloud by using Rule based Algorithm, thereby measuring the performance of the system by letting the system adapt new rules based on the feedback. Here performance of the action helps to make better allocation of the resources to improve quality of services, scalability and flexibility. The performance measure is based on how the allocation of the resources is dynamically optimized and how the resources are utilized properly. It aims to maximize the utilization of the resources. The data and resource are given to the algorithm which allocates the data to resources and an output is obtained based on the action occurred. Once the action is completed, the performance of every action is measured that contains how the resources are allocated and how efficiently it worked. In addition to performance, resource allocation in cloud environment is also considered.</p></span></span></span></li>

Nonetheless, the PSO performance depends on the fine tuning of different parameters. To make the algorithm design process more independent from human intervention, some researchers have treated this task as an optimization problem. Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming (GGGP) algorithms, in particular, have been widely studied and applied in the context of algorithm optimization. GGGP algorithms produce customized designs based on a set of production rules defined in the grammar, differently from methods that simply select designs in a pre-defined limited search space. Although GGGP algorithms have been largely used in other contexts, they have not been deeply investigated in the generation of PSO algorithms. Thus, this work applies GGGP algorithms in the context of PSO algorithm design problem. Herein, we performed an experimental study comparing different GGGP approaches for the generation of PSO algorithms. The main goal is to perform a deep investigation aiming to identify pros and cons of each approach in the current task. In the experiments, a comparison between a tree-based GGGP approach and commonly used linear GGGP approaches for the generation of PSO algorithms was performed. The results showed that the tree-based GGGP produced better algorithms than the counterparts. We also compared the algorithms generated by the tree-based technique to state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, and it achieved competitive results.</p></span></span></span></li>

Many studies have shown that heuristics evolved by genetic programming can outperform many existing heuristics manually designed in the literature. The flexibility of genetic programming also allows it to discover very sophisticated heuristics to deal with complex and dynamic production environments. However, as compared to other applications of genetic programming or scheduling applications of other evolutionary computation techniques, the configurations and requirements of genetic programming for production scheduling are more complicated. In this paper, a unified framework for automated design of production scheduling heuristics with genetic programming is developed. The goal of the framework is to provide the researchers with the overall picture of how genetic programming can be applied for this task and the key components. The framework is also used to facilitate our discussions and analyses of existing studies in the field. Finally, this paper shows how knowledge from machine learning and operations research can be employed and how the current challenges can be addressed.</p></span></span></span></li>

Optimization and machine learning techniques have been used to make the algorithm design process more independent on human intervention. Hyper-heuristic approaches, in particular, have been proposed to search the space of algorithms/heuristics and/or their components, and iteratively combine and adapt them for specific problems. Although flexible to produce customized algorithms, hyper-heuristics can be extremely costly procedures. This paper proposes a novel hybrid hyper-heuristic (H3AD), which combines an automated algorithm selection approach with a generative hyper-heuristic. This combination intends to reduce the cost of providing an algorithm for a new input problem by reusing algorithms previously built by hyper-heuristics to solve similar problems. H3AD was evaluated in a case study to optimize the design of Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms in unconstrained continuous optimization problems. The results showed that H3AD provided appropriate recommendations of algorithms, reusing the algorithms generated by the hyper-heuristic to new input problems. Besides, H3AD drastically reduced the time of providing a customized algorithm when compared to generative hyper-heuristics, without a significant loss of optimization performance.</p></span></span></span></li>

SPL approaches have been adopted by many software companies1 to ease reuse and reduce time and production costs. A feature represents a functionality that is visible to the user and can be designed as a variability, which represents a variable functionality that may or may not be present in a product.

Applications of the BBQP include mining discrete patterns from binary data, approximating matrices by rank-one binary matrices, computing the cut-norm of a matrix, and solving optimisation problems such as maximum weight biclique, bipartite maximum weight cut, maximum weight induced sub-graph of a bipartite graph, etc. For the BBQP, we first present several algorithmic components, specifically, hill climbers and mutations, and then show how to combine them in a high-performance metaheuristic. Instead of hand-tuning a standard metaheuristic to test the efficiency of the hybrid of the components, we chose to use an automated generation of a multi-component metaheuristic to save human time, and also improve objectivity in the analysis and comparisons of components. For this we designed a new metaheuristic schema which we call Conditional Markov Chain Search (CMCS). We show that CMCS is flexible enough to model several standard metaheuristics; this flexibility is controlled by multiple numeric parameters, and so is convenient for automated generation. We study the configurations revealed by our approach and show that the best of them outperforms the previous state-of-the-art BBQP algorithm by several orders of magnitude. In our experiments we use benchmark instances introduced in the preliminary version of this paper and described here, which have already become the de facto standard in the BBQP literature.</p></span></span></span></li>

However, due to the complexity of handling multiple objectives simultaneously, many approaches proposed in the literature often focus on the optimisation of a single objective when deciding the locations for a set of wind turbines spread across a given region. In this study, we tackle a multi-objective wind farm layout optimisation problem. Different from the previously proposed approaches, we are applying a high-level search method, known as selection hyper-heuristic to solve this problem. Selection hyper-heuristics mix and control a predefined set of low-level (meta)heuristics which operate on solutions. We test nine different selection hyper-heuristics including an online learning hyper-heuristic on a multi-objective wind farm layout optimisation problem. Our hyper-heuristic approaches manage three well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms as low-level metaheuristics. The empirical results indicate the success and potential of selection hyper-heuristics for solving this computationally difficult problem. We additionally explore other objectives in wind farm layout optimisation problems to gain a better understanding of the conflicting nature of those objectives.</p></span></span></span></li>

Generally, vehicles can be managed either centrally or decentrally. A common way to coordinate agents decentrally is to use the contract-net protocol (CNET) that uses auctions to allocate tasks among agents. To participate in an auction, agents require a method that estimates the value of a task. Typically, this method involves an optimization algorithm, e.g. to calculate the cost to insert a customer. Recently, hyper-heuristics have been proposed for automated design of heuristics. Two properties of automatically designed heuristics are particularly promising: (1) a generated heuristic computes quickly, it is expected therefore that hyper-heuristics perform especially well for urgent problems, and (2) by using simulation-based evaluation, hyper-heuristics can create a 'rule of thumb' that anticipates situations in the future. In the present paper we empirically evaluate whether hyper-heuristics, more specifically genetic programming (GP), can be used to improve agents decentrally coordinated via CNET. We compare several GP settings and compare the resulting heuristic with existing centralized and decentralized algorithms based on the OptaPlanner optimization library. The tests are conducted in real-time on a dynamic PDP dataset with varying levels of dynamism, urgency, and scale. The results indicate that the evolved heuristic always outperforms the optimization algorithm in the decentralized multi-agent system (MAS) and often outperforms the centralized optimization algorithm. Our paper demonstrates that designing MASs using genetic programming is an effective way to obtain competitive performance compared to traditional operational research approaches. These results strengthen the relevance of decentralized agent based approaches in dynamic logistics.</p></span></span></span></li>

Although, Visible light spectrum has the capability to provide very large system bandwidth (in THz), yet these systems have the limitation on account of limited modulation bandwidth. Besides, Visible light communication (VLC) systems also suffer due to multi-path propagation resulting in further depletion of system bandwidth due to pulse broadening. Therefore, one of the deployment objective of a visible light communication (VLC) system is to reduce the root mean square (RMS) delay parameter besides minimizing the number of LEDs. Hence, performance analysis of two geometrical shape structures mainly rectangular and circular models are explored for ubiquitous indoor coverage using hyper- heuristics evolutionary algorithm(HypEA) under spatial receiver mobility. Therefore, it is possible to achieve lower RMS delay spread and hence multi- fold increase in the overall system bandwidth without the use of complex system techniques like OFDM- MIMO etc.</p></span></span></span></li>

In the algorithm, a solution with a better performance is called best prey and focuses totally on exploitation whereas the solution with least performance is called predator and focuses totally on exploration. The remaining solutions are called ordinary prey and either exploit promising regions by following better performing solutions or explore the solution space by randomly running away from the predator. Recently, it has been shown that by increasing the number of best prey or predator, it is possible to adjust the degree of exploitation and exploration. Even though, this tuning has the advantage of easily controlling these search behaviors, it is not an easy task. As any other metaheuristic algorithm, the performance of prey predator algorithm depends on the proper degree of exploration and exploitation of the decision space. In this paper, the concept of hyperheuristic is employed to balance the degree of exploration and exploitation of the algorithm. So that it learns and decides the best search behavior for the problem at hand in iterations. The ratio of the number of the best prey and the predators are used as low level heuristics. From the simulation results the balancing of the degree of exploration and exploitation by using hyperheuristic mechanism indeed improves the performance of the algorithm. Comparison with other algorithms shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></span></span></span></li>

Owing to the intertwined dependencies of many software development activities and their geographical and temporal issues, there are potentially many overlapping test cases which can cause unwarranted redundancies across the shared modules (i.e. a test for one requirement may be covered by more than one test).

To overcome this obstacle, we integrate these meta-heuristics into a hyper-heuristic framework, which adaptively manage the low-level heuristics (LLH) by using feedback of their real-time performance in problem solving, and thus can find the most suitable LLH or their combination that can outperform any single LLH on each given instance.

The main issue of meta-heuristics is that they are built using domain-specific knowledge. Therefore, they require a great effort to be adapted to a new domain. The concept of Hyper-heuristic was proposed to solve this problem. Hyper-heuristics are search methods that aim to solve optimization problems by selecting or generating heuristics. Selection hyper-heuristics choose from a pool of heuristics a good one to be applied at the current stage of the optimization process. Although there are several works focused on selection hyper-heuristics, there is no consensus about which is the best way to define a selection strategy. In this work, a deterministic selection strategy based on the concepts of the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem is proposed for combinatorial optimization. Multi-armed bandit approaches define a selection function with two components; the first is based on the performance of an operator and the second based on the number of times that the operator was used. In this work, three MAB algorithms were implemented using the HyFlex framework. An empirical parameter configuration was performed to each algorithm, and the best setup was compared to the top ten CHeSC 2011 algorithms using the same methodology adopted during the competition. The results obtained were comparable to those attained by the literature. Moreover, it was concluded that the behavior of MAB selection is heavily affected by its parameters. As this is not a desirable behavior for hyper-heuristics, future research will investigate ways to better deal with the parameter setting.</p></span></span></span></li>

HOMs can better simulate real and subtle faults, reduce the number of generated mutants and test cases, and so on. However, the HOM space is potentially huge, and an efficient strategy to generate the best HOMs is fundamental. In the literature different strategies were proposed and evaluated, mainly to generate Second-Order Mutants (SOMs), but none has been proved to perform better in different situations. Due to this, the selection of the best strategy is an important task. Most times a lot of experiments need to be conducted. To help the tester in this task and to allow the use of HOMs in practice, this paper proposes a hyper-heuristic approach. Such approach is based on NSGA-II and uses the selection method Choice Function to automatically choose among different Low-Level Heuristics (LLHs), which, in this case, are search-operators related to existing SOM generation strategies. The performance of each LLH is related to some objectives such as the number of SOMs generated, the capacity to capture subtler faults and replace the constituent FOMs. In comparison with existing strategies, our approach obtained better results considering the used objectives, and statistically equivalent results considering mutation score with respect to the FOMs.</p></span></span></span></li>

It usually contains many (four or more) potentially conflicting objectives such as makespan and mean weighted tardiness. On the other hand, evolving dispatching rules using genetic programming has demonstrated to be a promising approach to solving job shop scheduling due to its flexibility and scalability. In this paper, we aim to solve many-objective job shop scheduling with genetic programming and NSGA-III. However, NSGA-III is originally designed to work with uniformly distributed reference points which do not match well with the discrete and non-uniform Pareto front in job shop scheduling problems, resulting in many useless points during evolution. These useless points can significantly affect the performance of NSGA-III and genetic programming. To address this issue and inspired by particle swarm optimisation, a new reference point adaptation mechanism has been proposed in this paper. Experiment results on many-objective benchmark job shop scheduling instances clearly show that prominent improvement in performance can be achieved upon using our reference point adaptation mechanism in NSGA-III and genetic programming.</p></span></span></span></li>

Various machine learning and optimising techniques, usually referred to as hyper-heuristics, have been applied to facilitate the design task. Two main approaches are either to utilise a general structure for dispatching rules and optimise its parameters or to simultaneously search for suitable structures and their parameters. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we focus on the first approach and develop new representations that are flexible enough to represent diverse rules and powerful enough to cope with complex shop conditions. Particle swarm optimisation is used in the proposed hyper-heuristic to find optimal rules based on the representations. The results suggest that the new representations are effective for different shop conditions and obtained rules are very competitive as compared to those evolved by genetic programming. Analyses also show that the proposed hyper-heuristic is significantly faster than genetic programming based hyper-heuristic.</p></span></span></span></li>

In this paper, we describe a choice function based hyper-heuristic called Pairwise Choice Function based Hyper-heuristic (PCFHH) for the pairwise test generation problem. PCFHH uses a combination of three measures to select and apply an effective low-level heuristic from a set of four low-level heuristics at any stage of the search.

Their popularity has to do with their low computational cost, their capability to generate (weakly) Pareto optimal solutions, and their effectiveness in solving many-objective optimization problems. Nevertheless, recent studies indicate that the search behavior of MOEAs strongly depends on the choice of the scalarizing function. Besides, this specification varies according to the Pareto-front geometry of the problem at hand. In this work, we present a novel hyper-heuristic for continuous search spaces, which combines the strengths and compensates for the weaknesses of different scalarizing functions. These heuristics have been proposed within the evolutionary multi-objective optimization and mathematical programming communities. Furthermore, the selection of heuristics is conducted through the s-energy, which measures the even distribution of a set of points in k-dimensional manifolds. Experimental results indicate that our proposed approach outperforms the use of a single heuristic as well as other state-of-the-art algorithms in the majority of the ZDT, DTLZ and WFG test problems.</p></span></span></span></li>

This paper is devoted to computational aspects of DEA models under the application of the Principle of Least Action. This principle guarantees that the efficient closest targets are determined as benchmarks for each assessed unit. Usually, these models have been addressed in the literature by applying unsatisfactory techniques, based fundamentally on combinatorial NP-hard problems. Recently, some heuristics have been developed to partially solve these DEA models. This paper improves the heuristic methods used in previous works by applying a combination of metaheuristics and an exact method. Also, a parameterized scheme of metaheuristics is developed in order to implement metaheuristics and hybridations/combinations, adapting them to the particular problem proposed here. In this scheme, some parameters are used to study several types of metaheuristics, like Greedy Random Adaptative Search Procedure, Genetic Algorithms or Scatter Search. The exact method is included inside the metaheuristic to solve the particular model presented in this paper. A hyperheuristic is used on top of the parameterized scheme in order to search, in the space of metaheuristics, for metaheuristics that provide solutions close to the optimum. The method is competitive with exact methods, obtaining fitness close to the optimum with low computational time.</p></span></span></span></li>

A solution chain in this algorithm is formed by successively applying a randomly chosen heuristic to the previous solution to generate the next solution. Operating in this way, the algorithm can benefit from the accumulated effect of applying multiple heuristics. A key factor in this algorithm is the strategy for choosing the sampling length. We discuss a balanced strategy in a setting that contains two agnostic assumptions: First, we do not have detailed knowledge about the problem domain being solved except that we have access to the objective function and a set of predefined heuristics. Secondly, we have no information about the amount of time allocated for running our algorithm. We present a theoretical guarantee on using this strategy to choose the sampling lengths and derive some variants based on this strategy. Empirical results also confirm that these strategies deliver desired behavior. Finally, we briefly discuss the extension of incorporating a learning mechanism into the algorithm.</p></span></span></span></li>

However, this neighbourhood search mechanism could not be directly applied to combinatorial discrete optimization problems. The employed and onlooker bees need to be equipped with problem-specific perturbative heuristics in order to tackle combinatorial discrete optimization problems. However, there is a large variety of available problem-specific heuristics. In this paper, a hyper-heuristic method, namely a Modified Choice Function (MCF), is applied such that it can regulate the selection of the neighbourhood search heuristics adopted by the employed and onlooker bees automatically. The proposed MCF-based ABC model is implemented using the Hyper-heuristic Flexible Framework (HyFlex). To demonstrate the  effectiveness of the proposed model, ten Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) instances available in HyFlex have been evaluated. The empirical results show that the proposed model is able to statistically outperform four out of five ABC variants throughout the optimization process.</p></span></span></span></li>

By using selective hyper-heuristics, we can derive benefits from the strength of low level heuristics and their components at different stages of the heuristic search. In this paper, a simple, general and effective selective hyper heuristic is presented. We introduce an iterated local search based hyper-heuristic framework that incorporates the adaptive operator selection scheme to learn through the search process. The considered iterative approach employs an action selection model to decide the perturbation strategy to apply in each step and a credit assignment module to score its performance. The designed framework allows us to employ any action selection model and credit assignment mechanism used in the literature. Empirical results and an analysis of six different action selection models against state-of-the-art approaches, across 39 problem instances, highlight the significant potential of the proposed selection hyper-heuristics. Further analysis on the adaptive behavior of the model suggests that two of the six models are able to learn the best performing perturbation strategy, resulting in significant performance gains.</p></span></span></span></li>

As there are many possible meta-heuristics, finding the most suitable meta-heuristic for a given problem is not a trivial task. In order to make this choice, one can design hyper-heuristics. In the literature, one can find some agent-based research whose focus is to propose a framework where meta-heuristics are considered as agents, that solve a given problem in a collaborative or competitive way. Most of these works focus on mono-objective meta-heuristics. Other works focus on how to select multi-objective meta-heuristics, but not using an agent-based approach. We present in this work an agent-based hyper-heuristic for choosing the most suitable evolutionary meta-heuristic for a given problem. Our approach performs a cooperative Copeland voting procedure, considering five different metrics, to define which one of three competitive evolutionary meta-heuristics should execute during a certain processing time. We use the Walking Fish Problem (WFG) suite with two and three objectives to analyse the proposed approach performance. The obtained results showed that in all cases our strategy found the most indicated evolutionary algorithm and gets competitive results against the state of art.</p></span></span></span></li>

Although hyper-heuristics have been found to be successful in many scenarios, little attention has been paid to the subsets of heuristics that these methods manage and apply. In several cases, heuristics can interfere with each other and can be harmful for the search. Thus, obtaining information about the differences among heuristics, and how they contribute to the search process is very important. The main contribution of this paper is an automatic heuristic-filtering process that allows hyper-heuristics to exclude heuristics that do not contribute to improving the solution. Based on some previous works in feature selection, two methods are proposed that rank heuristics and sequentially select only suitable heuristics in a hyper-heuristic framework. Our experiments over a set of Constraint Satisfaction Problem instances show that a hyper-heuristic with only selected heuristics obtains significantly better results than a hyper-heuristic containing all heuristics, in terms of running times. In addition, the success rate of solving such instances is better for the hyper-heuristic with the suitable heuristics than for the hyper-heuristic without our proposed filtering process.</p></span></span></span></li>

It considers a variety of stochastic factors to reeect the reality where the exact information such as the actual task demand and accessibilities of edges are unknown in advance. Existing works focus on obtaining a robust solution beforehand. However, it is also important to design eeective heuris-tics to adjust the solution in real time. In this paper, we develop a new Genetic Programming-based Hyper-Heuristic (GPHH) for automated heuristic design for UCARP. A novel eeective meta-algorithm is designed carefully to address the failures caused by the environment change. In addition, it employs domain knowledge to lter some infeasible candidate tasks for the heuristic function. e experimental results show that the proposed GPHH signiicantly outperforms the existing GPHH methods and manually designed heuristics. Moreover, we nd that eliminating the infeasible and distant tasks in advance can reduce much noise and improve the eecacy of the evolved heuristics. In addition, it is found that simply adding a slack factor to the expected task demand may not improve the performance of the GPHH.</p></span></span></span></li>

Simplified protein models are usually applied to simulate and study some characteristics of the protein folding process. Hence, many heuristic strategies have been applied in order to find simplified protein structures in which the protein configuration has the minimal energy. However, these strategies have difficulties in finding the optimal solutions to the longer sequences of amino-acids, due to the complexity of the problem and the huge amount of local optima. Hyper heuristics have proved to be useful in this type of context since they try to combine different heuristics strengths into a single framework. However, there is lack of work addressing the automated design of hyper-heuristics components. This paper proposes GEHyPSP, an approach which aims to achieve generation, through grammatical evolution, of selection mechanisms and acceptance criteria for a hyper-heuristic framework applied to PSP problem. We investigate the strengths and weaknesses of our approach on a benchmark of simplified protein models. GEHyPSP was able to reach the best known results for 7 instances from 11 that composed the benchmark set used to evaluate the approach.</p></span></span></span></li>

To minimise this burden one might resort to algorithms for the automatic selection of the most appropriate properties of a given ANN. A remarkable example of such methodologies is Grammar-based Genetic Programming. This work analyses and compares the use of two grammar-based methods, Grammatical Evolution (GE) and Structured Grammatical Evolution (SGE), to automatically design and configure ANNs. The evolved networks are used to tackle several classification datasets. Experimental results show that SGE is able to automatically build better models than GE, and that are competitive with the state of the art, outperforming hand-designed ANNs in all the used benchmarks.</p></span></span></span></li>

To solve this problem, Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have been successfully used in the field known as Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE). However, the design of a search-based approach is not an easy task for the software engineer, who can find some difficulties such as: the choice and configuration of the best MOEAs, the choice of the best search operators to be implemented, and so on. In addition to this, existing approaches are dependent on the problem domain and do not allow reuse. In this way the use of Hyper-Heuristic (HH) can help to obtain more generic and reusable search-based approaches, and because of this is considered a trend in the SBSE field. Following this trend and to contribute to reduce the software engineer's efforts, this work explores the use of a hyper-heuristic for automatic generation of MOEAs to select test products from the FM, considering three factors: pairwise coverage, mutation score and cost, given by the number of products. The HH is based on a grammar that represents the elements, parameters and components of existing MOEAs and implements evolutionary operators, such as crossover and mutation, suitable for selection problems. In this way, it can be reused for other similar software engineering problems. Evaluation results show that the proposed approach obtains results that are better or statistically equivalent than similar approaches found in the literature.</p></span></span></span></li>

The two main categories of hyper-heuristics are selection and generation. Selection hyper-heuristics select existing low-level heuristics while generation hyper-heuristics create new heuristics. At the inception of the field single point searches were essentially employed by selection hyper-heuristics, however as the field progressed evolutionary algorithms are becoming more prominent. Evolutionary algorithms, namely, genetic programming, have chiefly been used for generation hyper-heuristics. Implementing evolutionary algorithm hyper-heuristics can be quite a time-consuming task which is daunting for first time researchers and practitioners who want to rather focus on the application domain the hyper-heuristic will be applied to which can be quite complex. This paper presents a Java toolkit for the implementation of evolutionary algorithm hyper-heuristics, namely, EvoHyp. EvoHyp includes libraries for a genetic algorithm selection hyper-heuristic (GenAlg), a genetic programming generation hyper-heuristic (GenProg), a distributed version of GenAlg (DistrGenAlg) and a distributed version of GenProg (DistrGenProg). The paper describes the libraries and illustrates how they can be used. The ultimate aim is to provide a toolkit which a non-expert in evolutionary algorithm hyper-heuristics can use.

This paper presents an exploration into employing evolutionary computation for the automated design of category functions to obtain significantly enhanced Fuzzy ART performance through tailoring to specific problem classes. We employ a genetic programming powered hyper-heuristic approach where the category functions are constructed from a set of primitives constituting those of the original Fuzzy ART category function as well as additional hand-selected primitives. Results are presented for a set of experiments on benchmark classification tasks from the UCI Machine Learning Repository demonstrating that tailoring Fuzzy ART's category function can achieve statistically significant superior performance on the testing datasets in stratified 10-fold cross-validation procedures.

This, however, has given rise to the problem of choosing the most effective heuristic for a given problem. In recent years, one of the most used strategies for this task are the hyper-heuristics, which aim at selecting/generating heuristics to solve a wide range of optimization problems. Most of the existing selection hyper-heuristics attempt to recommend only one heuristic for a given instance. However, for some classes of problems, more than one heuristic can be suitable. With this premise, in this paper, we address this issue through an evolutionary multilabel learning approach for building hyper- heuristics. Unlike traditional approaches, in the multilabel formulation, the result could not be a single recommendation, but a set of potential heuristics. Due to the fact that cooperative coevolutionary algorithms allow us to divide the problem into several subproblems, it results in a natural approach for dealing with multilabel classification. The proposed cooperative coevolutionary multilabel approach aims at choosing the most relevant patterns for each heuristic. For the experimental study included in this paper, we have used a set of constraint satisfaction problems as our study case. Our experimental results suggest that the proposed method is able to generate accurate hyper-heuristics that outperform reference methods.</p></span></span></span></li>

The most challenging part of the problem is to make real-time decisions (i.e. whether to accept the newly arrived service requests or not) during the execution of the routes. It is hardly applicable to use the optimisation methods such as mathematical programming and evolutionary algorithms that are competitive for static problems, since they are usually time consuming, and cannot give real-time responses. In this paper, we consider solving this problem using heuristics. A heuristic gradually builds a solution by adding the requests to the end of the route one by one. This way, it can take advantage of the latest information when making the next decision, and give immediate response. In this paper, we propose a meta-algorithm to generate a solution given any heuristic. The meta-algorithm maintains a set of routes throughout the scheduling horizon. Whenever a new request arrives, it tries to re-generate new routes to include the new request by the heuristic. It accepts the new request if successful, and reject otherwise. Then we manually designed several heuristics, and proposed a genetic programming-based hyper-heuristic to automatically evolve heuristics. The results showed that the heuristics evolved by genetic programming significantly outperformed the manually designed heuristics.</p></span></span></span></li>

Usually, these techniques automatically generate or select new simpler components based on the feedback received during the search. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) have been applied as hyper-heuristics, using a probabilistic distribution model to extract and represent interactions between heuristics and its low-level components to provide high-valued problem solutions. In this paper, we consider an EDA-based hyper-heuristic framework which encompasses a Heuristic Selection approach aiming to find best combinations of different known heuristics. A surrogate assisted model evaluates the new heuristic combinations sampled by the EDA probabilistic model using an approximation function. We compare our proposed approach named Heuristic Selection based on Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (HSEDA) with three state-of-the-art algorithms for the Travelling Thief Problem (TTP). The experimental results show that the approach is competitive, outperforming the other algorithms on most of the medium-sized TTP instances considered in this paper.</p></span></span></span></li>

Modeling and implementing a new heuristic algorithm may be time-consuming but has strong motivations: on the one hand, even a small improvement of the new solution may be worth the long time spent on the construction of a new method; on the other hand, there are problems for which good-enough solutions are acceptable which could be achieved at a much lower computational cost. In the first case, specially designed heuristics or metaheuristics are needed, while the latter hyper-heuristics can be proposed.

One element of paramount importance, however, is the selection module that they incorporate. Traditional approaches define a set of features for characterizing a problem and, thus, define how to best solve it. However, some features may vary nonlinearly as the solver progresses, requiring higher resolution in specific areas of the feature domain. This work focuses on assessing the advantage of using feature transformations to improve the given resolution and, as a consequence, to improve the overall performance of a hyper-heuristic. We provide evidence that using feature transformations may result in a better discrimination of the problem instance and, as consequence, a better performance of the hyper-heuristics. The feature transformation strategy was applied to an evolutionary-based hyper-heuristic model taken from the literature and tested on constraint satisfaction problems The proposed strategy increased the median success rate of hyper-heuristics by more than 13\% and reduced its standard deviation in about 7\%, while reducing the median number of adjusted consistency checks by almost 30\%.</p></span></span></span></li>

In a DJSS problem instance, jobs arrive on the shop floor to be processed on specific sequences of machines on the shop floor and unforeseen events such as dynamic job arrivals and machine breakdown occur that affect the properties of the shop floor. Many researchers have proposed genetic programming based hyper-heuristic (GP-HH) approaches to evolve high quality dispatching rules for DJSS problems with dynamic job arrivals, outperforming good man-made rules for the problems. However, no GP-HH approaches have been proposed for DJSS problems with dynamic job arrivals and machine breakdowns, and it is not known how well GP generalises over both DJSS problem instances with no machine breakdown to problem instances with machine breakdown. Therefore, this paper investigates the generality of GP for DJSS problem with dynamic job arrivals and machine breakdowns. To do this, a machine breakdown specific DJSS dataset is proposed, and an analysis procedure is used to observe the differences in the structures of the GP rules when evolved under different machine breakdown scenarios. The results show that performance and the distributions of the terminals for the evolved rules is sensitive to the frequency of machine breakdowns in the training instances used to evolve the rules</p></span></span></span></li>

This article presents a comparison between state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics and a newly proposed iterated variable neighborhood descent algorithm when solving the course timetabling problem. Our formulation can be seen as an adaptive iterated local search algorithm that combines several move operators in the improvement stage. Our improvement stage not only uses several neighborhoods, but it also incorporates state-of-the-art reinforcement learning mechanisms to adaptively select them on the fly. Our approach substitutes the adaptive improvement stage by a variable neighborhood descent (VND) algorithm. VND is an ingredient of the more general variable neighborhood search (VNS), a powerful metaheuristic that systematically exploits the idea of neighborhood change. This leads to a more effective search process according course timetabling benchmark results.</p></span></span></span></li>

This study investigates a learning-via demonstrations approach generating a selection hyper-heuristic for Open Vehicle Routing Problem (OVRP). As a chosen 'expert' hyper-heuristic is run on a small set of training problem instances, data is collected to learn from the expert regarding how to decide which low-level heuristic to select and apply to the solution in hand during the search process. In this study, a Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) is used to extract hidden patterns within the collected data in the form of a classifier ,i.e an 'apprentice' hyper-heuristic, which is then used to solve the 'unseen' problem instances. Firstly, the parameters of TDNN are tuned using Taguchi orthogonal array as a design of experiments method. Then the influence of extending and enriching the information collected from the expert and fed into TDNN is explored on the behaviour of the generated apprentice hyper-heuristic. The empirical results show that the use of distance between solutions as an additional information collected from the expert generates an apprentice which outperforms the expert algorithm on a benchmark of OVRP instances.</p></span></span></span></li>

Work on hyper-heuristics for multi-objective optimization remains limited. This chapter draws attention to this area of research to help researchers and PhD students understand and reuse these methods.

Recent time complexity analyses for the LeadingOnes benchmark function have shown that the standard simple random, permutation, random gradient, greedy and reinforcement learning selection mechanisms show no effects of learning. The idea behind the learning mechanisms is to continue to exploit the currently selected heuristic as long as it is successful. However, the probability that a promising heuristic is successful in the next step is relatively low when perturbing a reasonable solution to a combinatorial optimisation problem. In this paper we generalise the classical selection-perturbation mechanisms so success can be measured over some fixed period of length r, rather than in a single iteration. We present a benchmark function where it is necessary to learn to exploit a particular low-level heuristic, rigorously proving that it makes the difference between an efficient and an inefficient algorithm. For LeadingOnes we prove that the generalised random gradient mechanism approaches optimal performance while generalised greedy, although not as fast, still outperforms random local search. An experimental analysis shows that combining the two generalised mechanisms leads to even better performance.</p></span></span></span></li>

In this work, we propose a hyper-heuristic based framework which can optimise DBNs independent from the problem domain. It is the first time hyper-heuristic entering this domain. The framework iteratively selects suitable heuristics based on a heuristic set, apply the heuristic to tune the DBN to better fit with the current search space. Under this framework the setting of DBN learning is adaptive. Three well-known image reconstruction benchmark sets were used for evaluating the performance of this new approach. Our experimental results show this hyper-heuristic approach can achieve high accuracy under different scenarios on diverse image sets. In addition state-of-the-art meta-heuristic methods for tuning DBN were introduced for comparison. The results illustrate that our hyper-heuristic approach can obtain better performance on almost all test cases.</p></span></span></span></li>

The background knowledge required to solve the task at hand is actually embedded into a search mechanism that builds personalized solutions to the task. Following this idea, this paper proposes RECIPE (REsilient ClassifIcation Pipeline Evolution), a framework based on grammar-based genetic programming that builds customized classification pipelines. The framework is flexible enough to receive different grammars and can be easily extended to other machine learning tasks. RECIPE overcomes the drawbacks of previous evolutionary-based frameworks, such as generating invalid individuals, and organizes a high number of possible suitable data pre-processing and classification methods into a grammar. Results of f-measure obtained by RECIPE are compared to those two state-of-the-art methods, and shown to be as good as or better than those previously reported in the literature. RECIPE represents a first step towards a complete framework for dealing with different machine learning tasks with the minimum required human intervention.</p></span></span></span></li>

In addition to human-designed heuristic packing policies (e.g. first- or best- fit), there has been interest over the last decade in the automatic generation of policies. One of the main limitations of some previously-used policy representations is the trade-off between locality and granularity in the associated search space. In this article, we adopt an interpolation-based representation which has the jointly-desirable properties of being sparse and continuous (i.e. exhibits good genotype-to-phenotype locality). In contrast to previous approaches, the policy space is searchable via real-valued optimization methods. Packing policies using five different interpolation methods are comprehensively compared against a range of existing methods from the literature, and it is determined that the proposed method scales to larger instances than those in the literature.</p></span></span></span></li>

Even though the manufacturing environment is uncertain, most of the existing research works consider merely deterministic problems where the time required for processing any job is known in advance and never changes. However many DJSS problems in practice involve high level of uncertainty that must be explicitly addressed. In this work, we consider DJSS problems with varied uncertainty configurations of machines in terms of processing times. We find that with the varying levels of uncertainty, more and more machines cannot fulfill their duties as scheduled and will become bottlenecks of the job shop. To cope with uncertainties, it is therefore essential to identify these bottleneck machines and schedule the jobs to be performed by them carefully. Driven by this idea, we develop a new effective method to evolve pairs of dispatching rules each for a different bottleneck level on the machines. A clustering approach to classify the bottleneck level of the machines arising in the system due to uncertain processing times is proposed. Then, a cooperative co-evolution technique to evolve pairs of dispatching rules which generalizes well across different uncertainty configurations is presented. We perform empirical analysis to show its generalization characteristic over the different uncertainty configurations and show that the proposed method outperforms the current approaches.</p></span></span></span></li>

The problem stems from real-world applications and is significant in theoretical values and applicability in resource allocation tasks where groupings must be considered. The aim of this problem is to minimize the total operational cost in a warehouse through stock rearrangement. The problem consists of two interdependent subproblems, grouping same product items and assigning items to minimize picking distance. The interactions between these two subproblems make this problem significantly different from previous Storage Location Assignment Problems (SLAP), a well-studied field in logistics. Existing approaches for SLAP are not directly applicable for SLAP-GC. This dissertation lays a foundation for research on grouping constraints and other optimisation problems with similar interactions between subproblems. Firstly this study presents a formal definition of SLAP-GC. Then it offers a formal proof of NP-completeness of SLAP-GC by reducing from a well-known 3-Partition problem to SLAP-GC. This suggests that the real-world instances of SLAP-GC should not be tackled with exact approaches, but with approximation and heuristic approaches. Then, we explored decomposition and modelling techniques for SLAP-GC and developed three types of promising heuristic approaches: a hyperheuristic approach, a metaheuristic approach and a matheuristic approach. Comprehensive experimental studies are conducted on both synthetic benchmark instances and real-world instances to examine their efficiency, efficacy, and scalability. Through the analysis of the experimental results, the suitability of proposed methods is verified on various SLAP-GC scenarios. In addition, we demonstrate in this study that with the proposed decomposition, large-scale SLAP-GC can be handled efficiently by the three proposed heuristic-based approaches.</p></span></span></span></li>

Along with continuous growth in computing power, many asset management decision-making processes that were originally solved by hand now tend to be based on big data analysis. Larger scale problem can be solved and more detailed operation instructions can be delivered.

In this thesis, we investigate models and algorithms to solve large scale Geographically Distributed asset Maintenance Problems (GDMP). Our study of the problem was motivated by our business partner, Gaist solutions Ltd., to optimise scheduling of maintenance actions for a drainage system in an urban area. The models and solution methods proposed in the thesis can be applied to many similar issues arising in other industry fields.

The thesis contains three parts. We firstly built a risk driven model considering vehicle routing problems and the asset degradation information. A hyperheuristic method embedded with customised low-level heuristics is employed to solve our real-world drainage maintenance problem in Blackpool. Computational results show that our hyperheuristic approach can, within reasonable CPU time, produce much higher quality solutions than the scheduling strategy currently implemented by Blackpool council.

We then attempt to develop more efficient solution approaches to tackle our GDMP. We study various hyperheuristics and propose efficient local search strategies in part II. We present computational results on standard periodic vehicle routing problem instances and our GDMP instances. Based on manifold experimental evidences, we summarise the principles of designing heuristic based solution approaches to solve combinatorial problems.

Last bu not least, we investigate a related decision making problem from highway maintenance, that is again of interest to Gaist solutions Ltd. We aim to make a strategical decision to choose a cost effective method of delivering the road inspection at a national scale. We build the analysis based on the Chinese Postman Problem and theoretically proof the modelling feasibility in real-world road inspection situations. We also propose a novel graph reduction process to allow effective computation over very large data sets.</p></span></span></span></li>

It has been observed that different heuristics perform differently between different optimisation problems. A hyper-heuristic combines a set of predefined heuristics, and applies a machine learning technique to predict which heuristic is the most suitable to apply at a given point in time while solving a given problem. A variety of machine learning techniques have been proposed in the literature. Most of the existing machine learning techniques are reinforcement learning mechanisms interacting with the search environment with the goal of adapting the selection of heuristics during the search process. The literature on the theoretical foundation of reinforcement learning hyper-heuristics is almost nonexisting. This work provides theoretical analyses of reinforcement learning hyper-heuristics. The goal is to shed light on the learning capabilities and limitations of reinforcement learning hyper-heuristics. This improves our understanding of these hyper-heuristics, and aid the design of better reinforcement learning hyper-heuristics. It is revealed that the commonly used additive reinforcement learning mechanism, under a mild assumption, chooses asymptotically heuristics uniformly at random. This thesis also proposes the problem of identifying the most suitable heuristic with a given error probability. We show a general lower bound on the time that "every" reinforcement learning hyper-heuristic needs to identify the most suitable heuristic with a given error probability. The results reveal a general limitation to learning achieved by this computational approach. Following our theoretical analysis, different reusable and easyto-implement reinforcement learning hyper-heuristics are proposed in this thesis. The proposed hyper-heuristics are evaluated on well-known combinatorial optimisation problems. One of the proposed reinforcement learning hyper-heuristics outperformed a state-of-the-art algorithm on several benchmark problems of the well-known CHeSC 2011.</p></span></span></span></li>

Since it is a practical decision-making problem with high complexity and large problem instances, a hybrid evolutionary hyper-heuristic (HEH) approach, which combines heuristic generation and heuristic selection, is developed in this paper. In order to increase the diversity and effectiveness of heuristic rules, genetic programming is used to automatically generate new rules based on the attributes of parts, machines, and vehicles. The new rules are added to the candidate rule set, and a rule selection genetic algorithm is developed to choose appropriate rules for machines and vehicles. Finally, scheduling solutions are obtained using the selected rules. A comparative evaluation is conducted, with some state-of-the-art hyper-heuristic approaches which lack some of the strategies proposed in HEH, with a meta-heuristic approach that is suitable for large scale scheduling problems, and with adaptations of some well-known heuristic rules. Computational results show that the new rules generated in HEH have similarities to the best-performing human-made rules, but are more effective due to the evolutionary processes in HEH. Moreover, the HEH approach has advantages over other approaches in both computational efficiency and solution quality, and is especially suitable for problems with large instance sizes. Note to Practitioners-Our survey of the equipment manufacturing industry in China indicates that, for complex products like synthetic transmission devices, intercell transfers occur in the processing routes of more than 51% of parts. More than 47% of tardy parts are caused by inefficient intercell cooperation. Therefore, intercell transfers are inevitable and it is worth an effort to find out an effective approach to intercell scheduling. To solv- intercell scheduling problems, two characteristics in industrial environments of complex products cannot be neglected. The first one is the large problem sizes, which involve up to hundreds of parts and thousands of operations; and the second one is the importance of transportation to intercell scheduling, which involves allocation and utilization of vehicles. However, sufficient transportation capacity is taken as a common assumption in most of research with respect to intercell scheduling, which shields the transportation dimension and hinders the application of these intercell scheduling approaches. Therefore, intercell scheduling with limited transportation capacity is considered, and a hybrid evolutionary hyper-heuristic is proposed in this paper. The advantages of this approach lie in that, (i) as a hyper-heuristic, it provides high computational efficiency, which is suitable for industrial environments with large problem sizes; and (ii) genetic programming is employed to generate problem-specific heuristic rules, which enhances the learning and searching ability of the approach. We compare the proposed approach with the man-made heuristic rules that are widely used in practice. Experimental results indicate that, for hundreds of parts and thousands of operations, given the same running time, our approach outperforms man-made rules with an average gap of 60.6% in minimizing total weighted tardiness. Therefore, our approach is advantageous in both computational efficiency and solution quality, and is especially suitable for the intercell scheduling problems in practice.</p></span></span></span></li>

This allows them to extend their applicability to different problem domains without major redesign, unlike traditional methods such as metaheuristics. In this work, a hyper-heuristic is evaluated for a transportation problem. The implemented hyper-heuristic uses a greedy operator, and it implements an adapter layer that would allow it to be used in other similar problems.

The ensemble adopts a divide-and-conquer approach in which each heuristic solves a unique subset of the instance set considered. NELLI-GP extends an existing ensemble method called NELLI by introducing a novel heuristic generator that evolves heuristics composed of linear sequences of dispatching rules: each rule is represented using a tree structure and is itself evolved. Following a training period, the ensemble is shown to outperform both existing dispatching rules and a standard genetic programming algorithm on a large set of new test instances. In addition, it obtains superior results on a set of 210 benchmark problems from the literature when compared to two state-of-the-art hyperheuristic approaches. Further analysis of the relationship between heuristics in the evolved ensemble and the instances each solves provides new insights into features that might describe similar instances.</p></span></span></span></li>

The most common way to solve this problem involves the use of heuristics that guide the search into promising areas of the space. In this article, we present a novel way to combine the strengths of distinct heuristics to produce solution methods that perform better than such heuristics on a wider range of instances. The methodology proposed produces neural networks that represent hyper-heuristics for variable ordering in constraint satisfaction problems. These neural networks are generated and trained by running a genetic algorithm that has the task of evolving the topology of the networks and some of their learning parameters. The results obtained suggest that the produced neural networks represent a feasible alternative for coding hyper-heuristics that control the use of different heuristics in such a way that the cost of the search is minimized.</p></span></span></span></li>

In a selection hyper-heuristic framework, a heuristic is chosen from an existing set of low-level heuristics and applied to the current solution to produce a new solution at each point in the search. The use of crossover low-level heuristics is possible in an increasing number of general-purpose hyper-heuristic tools such as HyFlex and Hyperion. However, little work has been undertaken to assess how best to utilise it. Since a single-point search hyper-heuristic operates on a single candidate solution, and two candidate solutions are required for crossover, a mechanism is required to control the choice of the other solution. The frameworks we propose maintain a list of potential solutions for use in crossover. We investigate the use of such lists at two conceptual levels. First, crossover is controlled at the hyper-heuristic level where no problem-specific information is required. Second, it is controlled at the problem domain level where problem-specific information is used to produce good-quality solutions to use in crossover. A number of selection hyper-heuristics are compared using these frameworks over three benchmark libraries with varying properties for an NP-hard optimisation problem: the multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problem. It is shown that allowing crossover to be managed at the domain level outperforms managing crossover at the hyper-heuristic level in this problem domain.</p></span></span></span></li>

The aim of this system is to combine the advantages of the hyper-heuristic for learning useful scheduling rules and the meta-heuristic for further refining the solutions from the obtained rules.

A selection hyper-heuristic mixes and controls a predefined set of low level heuristics with the goal of improving an initially generated solution by choosing and applying an appropriate heuristic to a solution in hand and deciding whether to accept or reject the new solution at each step under an iterative framework.

The hyper-heuristic is a high-level approach that can select and apply an appropriate low-level heuristic at each decision point. In this paper, we present a selection hyper-heuristic with online learning that is used to design and adaptively control an ensemble of many different genetic algorithms. The proposed approach combines concepts of the island model and cooperative and competitive coevolutions. The general method and some particular applications are discussed. The experimental results for a wide range of optimization problems are presented. The experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms its component metaheuristics on average.

This problem is a well known hard computational problem which has been of interest to practitioners as well as researchers. High schools need to timetable their regular activities once per year, or even more frequently. The exact solvers might fail to find a solution for a given instance of the problem. A selection hyper-heuristic can be defined as an easy-to-implement, easy-to-maintain and effective `heuristic to choose heuristics' to solve such computationally hard problems. This paper describes the approach of the team hyper-heuristic search strategies and timetabling (HySST) to high school timetabling which competed in all three rounds of the third international timetabling competition. HySST generated the best new solutions for three given instances in Round 1 and gained the second place in Rounds 2 and 3.

Methods: We proved this problem is NP-complete problem and used heuristic algorithms to solve it. When the data set is small, most existing algorithms can reach the optimal solution using linear programming. However, traditional greedy algorithm and off-trap strategy fail to give reasonable results in large data set. In this study, we used the algorithm with appropriate oblivion strategy for efficient convergence and optimal solution. Results: To compare different algorithms, synthetic data sets of different size and a year's clinical data set provided by the hospital were used. The outcome of our algorithm was closely matched to the optimal solution from linear programming for sixty synthetic data sets. In addition, our algorithm is more efficient than that of linear programming when clinical data set was used. Meanwhile we found that the outcome is an approximate optimal solution and the algorithm is able to save a lot of cost for the hospital in practice. Conclusions: In this paper, we analyzed the results obtained from the algorithms of data set of different size and found that the algorithm can handle large volumes of data efficiently and reduce cost of hospitals.</p></span></span></span></li>

The overall goal is maximising the average bin fullness. We investigate a 'policy matrix' representation, which assigns a score for each decision option independently and the option with the highest value is chosen, for one-dimensional online bin packing. A policy matrix might also be considered as a heuristic with many parameters, where each parameter value is a score. We hence effectively investigate a framework which can be used for creating heuristics via many parameters. The proposed framework combines a Genetic Algorithm optimiser, which searches the space of heuristics in policy matrix form, and an online bin packing simulator, which acts as the evaluation function. The empirical results indicate the success of the proposed approach, providing the best solutions for almost all item sequence generators used during the experiments. We also present a novel fitness landscape analysis on the search space of policies. This study hence gives evidence of the potential for automated discovery by intelligent systems of powerful heuristics for online problems; reducing the need for expensive use of human expertise.</p></span></span></span></li>

Each neighborhood is accompanied by a weight value which represents the probability of being chosen at each iteration. These weights are fixed before the algorithm runs, and are considered as parameters of the algorithm. Given a set of instances, off-line tuning of the algorithm's parameters can be done by automated algorithm configuration tools (e.g., SMAC). However, the large number of neighborhoods can make the tuning expensive and difficult even when the number of parameters has been reduced by some intuition. In this work, we propose a systematic method to characterize each neighborhood's behaviours, representing them as a feature vector, and using cluster analysis to form similar groups of neighborhoods. The novelty of our characterization method is the ability of reflecting changes of behaviours according to hardness of different solution quality regions. We show that using neighborhood clusters instead of individual neighborhoods helps to reduce the parameter configuration space without misleading the search of the tuning procedure. Moreover, this method is problem-independent and potentially can be applied in similar contexts.</p></span></span></span></li>

In this paper, we propose a selection hyper-heuristic process with the intention to rise the level of generality and solve consistently well a wide range of constraint satisfaction problems. The hyper-heuristic technique is based on a messy genetic algorithm that generates high-level heuristics formed by rules (condition -> heuristic). The high-level heuristics produced are seen to be good at solving instances from certain parts of the parameterized space of problems, producing results using effort comparable to the best single heuristic per instance. This is beneficial, as the choice of best heuristic varies from instance to instance, so the high-level heuristics are definitely preferable to selecting any one low-level heuristic for all instances. The results confirm the robustness of the proposed approach and how high-level heuristics trained for some specific classes of instances can also be applied to unseen classes without significant lost of efficiency. This paper contributes to the understanding of heuristics and the way they can be used in a collaborative way to benefit from their combined strengths.</p></span></span></span></li>

The supply chain management (SCM) with cross-docks is both effective and efficient where no storage is facilitated at the cross-dock and the order-picking is replaced by fast consolidation. However, cross-docking involves interrelated operations such as vehicle routing and vehicle scheduling which require proper planning and synchronization. Traditional cross-docking methods treat the operations separately and overlook the potential advantage of cooperative planning. This paper proposes a bi-objective mathematical formulation for the cross-docking with the noted new challenges. As the addressed problem is highly constrained, we develop a cooperative coevolution approach consisting of Hyper-heuristics and Hybrid-heuristics for achieving continuous improvement in alternating objectives. The performance of our approach is illustrated with real geographical data and is compared with existing models. Statistical tests based on intensive simulations, including the convergence 95% confidence analysis and the worst-case analysis, are conducted to provide reliable performance guarantee.</p></span></span></span></li>

It is important to select a minimum number of products but, at the same time, to consider the coverage of testing criteria such as pairwise, among other factors. To solve such problems Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have been successfully applied. However, to design a solution for this and other software engineering problems can be very difficult, because it is necessary to choose among different search operators and parameters. Hyper-heuristics can help in this task, and have raised interest in the Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) field. Considering the growing adoption of SPL in the industry and crescent demand for SPL testing approaches, this paper introduces a hyper-heuristic approach to automatically derive products to variability testing of SPLs. The approach works with MOEAs and two selection methods, random and based on FRR-MAB (Fitness Rate Rank based Multi-Armed Bandit). It was evaluated with real FMs and the results show that the proposed approach outperforms the traditional algorithms used in the literature, and that both selection methods present similar performance.</p></span></span></span></li>

In such a learning environment that guides students to observe and learn from real-world targets, various physical world constraints need to be taken into account when planning learning paths for individuals. In this study, an optimization problem is formulated by taking the relevance of real-world learning targets and the environmental constraints into account when determining personalized learning paths in the real world to maximize students' learning efficacy. Moreover, a hyper-heuristic approach is proposed to efficiently find quality learning paths for individual students. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, the teachers' feedback was collected and analyzed based on the learning activities conducted in an elementary school natural science course; in addition, the performances of the proposed algorithm and other approaches were compared based on a set of test data.</p></span></span></span></li>

In this paper, we developed a three-level hyper-heuristic framework to generate algorithms for the problem. From elementary components and multiple sets of problem instances, algorithms are generated. The best algorithms are selected to go through a second step process, where they are evaluated with problem instances that differ in size and difficulty. The problem instances are generated according to methods that are found in the literature. In all of the larger problem instances, the generated algorithms have less than 1 % error with respect to the optimal solution. Additionally, generated algorithms are efficient, taking on average fractions of a second to find a solution for any instance, with a standard deviation of 1 s. In terms of structure, hyper-heuristic algorithms are compact in size compared with those in the literature, allowing an in-depth analysis of their structure and their presentation to the scientific world.</p></span></span></span></li>

This approach can be considered as a generation hyper-heuristic. A grammar to express heuristics is extracted from successful human-designed variable-selection heuristics. The search is performed on the derivation sequences of this grammar using a strongly typed genetic programming framework. The approach brings two innovations to grammar-based hyper-heuristics in this domain: the incorporation of if-then-else rules to the function set, and the implementation of overloaded functions capable of handling different input dimensionality. Moreover, the heuristic search space is explored using not only evolutionary search, but also two alternative simpler strategies, namely, iterated local search and parallel hill climbing. We tested our approach on synthetic and real-world instances. The newly generated heuristics have an improved performance when compared against human-designed heuristics. Our results suggest that the constrained search space imposed by the proposed grammar is the main factor in the generation of good heuristics. However, to generate more general heuristics, the composition of the training set and the search methodology played an important role. We found that increasing the variability of the training set improved the generality of the evolved heuristics, and the evolutionary search strategy produced slightly better results.</p></span></span></span></li>

This problem is finding effective features among the set of all features in such that the final feature set can improve accuracy and reduce complexity. Since feature selection is an NP-Hard problem, many heuristic algorithms have been studied so far to solve this problem.
In this paper, we propose a novel method based on hyper-heuristic approach to find an efficient proper feature subset which is named Hyper-Heuristic Feature Selection (HHFS). In the proposed method, Low level heuristics are categorized into two groups: the first group contains exploiters which cause to exploit the search space efficiently by improving the quality of the candidate solution at hand; the second one includes explorer heuristics which explore the solution space by dwelling on random perturbations. Since each region of the solution space can have its own characteristics, an appropriate low level heuristic should be selected and applied to the current solution. We propose Genetic Algorithm to select among the set of low level heuristic and balance between exploitation and exploration. It chooses the low level heuristic based on the existing functional history of low level heuristic. We aim to investigate the role of cooperation between low level heuristics within a hyper-heuristic framework to find the best feature subset. Since different low level heuristics have different strengths and weaknesses, we believe that cooperation can allow the strengths of one low level heuristic to compensate for the weaknesses of another. In this study, we also propose Adaptive Hyper-Heuristic Feature Selection (AHHFS) which is an extension of HHFS. Empirical study of the proposed method on several commonly used data sets from UCI repository indicates that it outperforms recent methods in the literature for feature selection.</p></span></span></span></li>

To analyze the efficacy of Multi-objective Hyper-heuristic Evolutionary Algorithm (MHypEA) in solving real-world clustering problems and to compare the results with the reported results in the literature for single as well as multi-objective formulations of the problem and also to present a CASE tool that assists software engineers in software module clustering process.
The paper reports on empirical evaluation of the performance of MHypEA with the reported results in the literature. The comparison is mainly based on two factors - quality of the obtained solutions and the computational effort.
On all the attempted problems, MHypEA reported good results in comparison to all the studies that were reported on multi-objective formulation of the problem, with a computational effort of nearly one-twentieth of the computational effort required by the other multi-objective algorithms.

Different policies exist to set up look-ahead methods differing in the object of inspection and in the extensiveness of the search. In this work, two original look-ahead strategies are developed and tested through numerical experiments. The first method introduces a look-ahead mechanism that acts as a hyper-heuristic for comparing and selecting local-search operators. The second method uses a look-ahead strategy on a lower level in order to guide a local-search metaheuristic. The proposed approaches are implemented using a hyper-heuristic framework. They are tested against alternative methods using two different competition benchmarks, including a comparison with results given in literature. Furthermore, in a second set of experiments, a detailed investigation regarding the influence of particular parameter values is executed for one method. The experiments reveal that the inclusion of a simple look-ahead principle into an iterated local-search procedure significantly improves the outcome regarding the considered benchmarks.</p></span></span></span></li>

The demand for each item is considered to be dependent not only on its and other items' allocated shelf space and displayed locations, but also on spatial relationships between items. Joint optimization models are developed for two different scenarios: (a) each item is replenished individually; and (b) multiple items are replenished jointly. A multi-stage simulated annealing (SA) based hyper-heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve both joint optimization models. These models are then evaluated numerically for different problem sizes. The results demonstrate that: (1) the proposed SA based hyper-heuristic algorithm is robust and efficient for both joint optimization models; and (2) the model for the joint replenishment policy leads to a higher profit than that of the model for the individual replenishment policy. Hence, the joint optimization model with joint replenishment policy will be helpful for retailers making decisions about shelf display arrangement and inventory control for multiple items.</p></span></span></span></li>

Applications of the BBQP include mining discrete patterns from binary data, approximating matrices by rank-one binary matrices, computing the cut-norm of a matrix, and solving optimisation problems such as maximum weight biclique, bipartite maximum weight cut, maximum weight induced sub-graph of a bipartite graph, etc. For the BBQP, we first present several algorithmic components, specifically, hillclimbers and mutations, and then show how to combine them in a high-performance metaheuristic. Instead of hand-tuning a standard metaheuristic to test the efficiency of the hybrid of the components, we chose to use an automated generation of a multi-component metaheuristic to save human time, and also improve objectivity in the analysis and comparisons of components. For this we designed a new metaheuristic schema which we call Conditional Markov Chain Search (CMCS). We show that CMCS is flexible enough to model several standard metaheuristics; this flexibility is controlled by multiple numeric parameters, and so is convenient for automated generation. We study the configurations revealed by our approach and show that the best of them outperforms the previous state-of-the-art BBQP algorithm by several orders of magnitude.

The GRASP is a well-known two-phase metaheuristic. First, a construction phase builds a complete solution iteratively, component by component, by a greedy randomized algorithm. After that, a local search phase improves this solution. The choice of a component and the order in which it is added in a solution mostly depend on its incremental cost. Thus, a basic GRASP configuration is defined by a cost function, a probabilistic parameter of greediness and a neighbourhood structure. We consider five cost functions and seven well-known neighbourhood structures. In this paper a cost function based on a bounding operator is integrated in GRASP for the first time. Mechanisms that investigate automatically algorithm configurations refer to hyper-heuristics. Our hyper-heuristic investigates 315 GRASP configurations and reports which one produces better results. Parallel multi-core computing is used as a way to efficiently implement the hyper-heuristic.

In this paper, the problem is defined as energy-constrained performance optimization and performance-constrained energy optimization. Task scheduling for precedence-constrained parallel applications represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in HMCSs is an NP-HARD problem. Over the last three decades, several task scheduling techniques have been developed for energy-aware scheduling. However, it is impossible for a single task scheduling technique to outperform all other techniques for all types of applications and situations. Motivated by these observations, hyperheuristic framework is introduced. Moreover, a quantum-inspired high-level learning strategy is proposed to improve the performance of this framework. Meanwhile, a fast solution evaluation technique is designed to reduce the computational burden for each iteration step. Experimental results show that the fast solution evaluation technique can improve average algorithm search speed by 38 percent and that the proposed algorithm generally exhibits outstanding convergence performance.</p></span></span></span></li>

Feature selection is a problem of finding efficient features among all features in which the final feature set can improve accuracy and reduce complexity. One way to solve this problem is to evaluate all possible feature subsets. However, evaluating all possible feature subsets is an exhaustive search and thus it has high computational complexity. Until now many heuristic algorithms have been studied for solving this problem. Hyper-heuristic is a new heuristic approach which can search the solution space effectively by applying local searches appropriately. Each local search is a neighborhood searching algorithm. Since each region of the solution space can have its own characteristics, it should be chosen an appropriate local search and apply it to current solution. This task is tackled to a supervisor. The supervisor chooses a local search based on the functional history of local searches. By doing this task, it can trade of between exploitation and exploration. Since the existing heuristic cannot trade of between exploration and exploitation appropriately, the solution space has not been searched appropriately in these methods and thus they have low convergence rate. For the first time, in this paper use a hyper-heuristic approach to find an efficient feature subset. In the proposed method, genetic algorithm is used as a supervisor and 16 heuristic algorithms are used as local searches. Empirical study of the proposed method on several commonly used data sets from UCI data sets indicates that it outperforms recent existing methods in the literature for feature selection.</p></span></span></span></li>

Using the proposed approach, we solved a set of classical test problems on process synthesis and design and compared the results with those of several state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms. To verify the consistency of the proposed approach, the above-mentioned comparison was made with respect to the percentage of convergences to the global optimum (NRC) and the average number of objective function evaluations (NFE) over several trials.

However, they are simple but there is much room to improve these algorithms. This study presents a heuristic scheduling algorithm, called High performance hyper-heuristic scheduling algorithm (HHSA) using detection operator, to find better scheduling solutions for real and cloud computing systems. The two operators - diversity detection and improvement detection operators - are employed in this algorithm to determine the timing to determine the heuristic algorithm. These two are employed to dynamically determine a low level heuristic that can be used to find better solution. To evaluate the performance of this method, authors examined the above method with several scheduling algorithms and results prove that Hyper Heuristic Scheduling Algorithm can significantly decrease the makespan of task scheduling when compared with all other scheduling algorithms. A novel high-performance hyper-heuristic algorithm is proposed for scheduling on cloud computing systems to reduce the makespan. This algorithm can be applied to both sequence dependent and sequence independent scheduling problems.</p></span></span></span></li>

In a systematic review of Max-Cut and Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) heuristics papers, we found only 4% publish source code, only 14% compare heuristics with identical termination criteria, and most experiments are performed with an artificial, homogeneous set of problem instances. To address these limitations, we implement and release as open-source a code-base of 10 MaxCut and 27 QUBO heuristics. We perform heuristic evaluation using cloud computing across a library of 3,296 instances. This large-scale evaluation provides insight into the types of problem instances for which each heuristic performs well or poorly. Because no single heuristic outperforms all others across all problem instances, we use machine learning to predict which heuristic will work best on a previously unseen problem instance, a key question facing practitioners.</p></span></span></span></li>

The vast majority of approaches apply selective hyper-heuristic methods that iteratively choose appropriate heuristics from a fixed set of pre-defined low-level heuristics to either build or perturb a candidate solution. We propose a novel hyper-heuristic called GP-MHH that operates in two stages. The first stage uses a novel Genetic Programming (GP) approach to evolve high quality constructive heuristics; these can be used with any existing method that relies on a candidate solution(s) as its starting point. In the second stage, a perturbative hyper-heuristic is applied to candidate solutions created from the new heuristics. The new constructive heuristics are shown to outperform existing low-level heuristics. When combined with a naive perturbative hyper-heuristic they provide results which are both competitive with known optimal values and outperform a recent method that also designs new heuristics on some standard benchmarks. Finally, we provide results on a set of rich VRPs, showing the generality of the approach.</p></span></span></span></li>

One of the design decisions that often has to be made when developing intelligent systems is the low-level construction heuristic to use. These are usually rules of thumb derived based on human intuition. Generally a heuristic is derived for a particular domain. However, according to the no free lunch theorem different low-level heuristics will be effective for different problem instances. Deriving low-level heuristics for problem instances will be time consuming and hence we examine the automatic induction of low-level heuristics using hyper-heuristics. We investigate this for classical artificial intelligence. At the inception of the field of artificial intelligence search methods to solve problems were generally uninformed, such as the depth first and breadth first searches, and did not take any domain specific knowledge into consideration. As the field matured domain specific knowledge in the form of heuristics were used to guide the search, thereby reducing the search space. Search methods using heuristics to guide the search became known as informed searches, such as the best-first search, hill-climbing and the A* algorithm. Heuristics used by these searches are problem specific rules of thumb created by humans. This study investigates the use of a generative hyper-heuristic to derive these heuristics. The hyper-heuristic employs genetic programming to evolve the heuristics. The approach was tested on two classical artificial intelligence problems, namely, the 8-puzzle problem and Towers of Hanoi. The genetic programming system was able to evolve heuristics that produced solutions for 20 8-puzzle problems and 5 instances of Towers of Hanoi. Furthermore, the heuristics induced were able to produce solutions to the instances of the 8-puzzle problem which could not be solved using the A* algorithm with the number of tiles out of place heuristic and at least one admissible heuristic was evolved for all 25 problems.</p></span></span></span></li>

In this paper, a hyper-heuristic is proposed to solve the ski-lodge problem which involves allocating shared-time apartments to customers during a skiing season in a way that achieves a certain objective while respecting the constraints of the problem. Prior approaches to the problem include simulated annealing and genetic algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the ski-lodge problem is approached from a hyper-heuristic perspective. Although the aim of hyper-heuristics is to provide good results over problem sets rather than producing best results for certain problem instances, for completeness and to get an idea of the quality of solutions, the results of the proposed hyper-heuristic are compared to that of genetic algorithm and simulated annealing. The hyper-heuristic was found to perform better than simulated annealing and comparatively to the genetic algorithm, producing better results for some of the instances. Furthermore, the hyper-heuristic has better overall performance over the problem set being considered.</p></span></span></span></li>

Three low-level heuristics are defined and used as building blocks of the HH. Based on the newly defined building blocks and fitness evaluation function, the Self-Learning Gene Expression Programming (SL-GEP) is utilized to automatically evolve a suitable HH. To test its effectiveness, the proposed framework is applied to learn suitable HHs based on real video data. The best HH learned is then applied to generate crowd simulations and the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective to generate realistic crowd dynamics.</p></span></span></span></li>

An evolutionary algorithm's performance can be improved by utilizing operators called domain-specific heuristics that incorporate domain knowledge, but existing knowledge-intensive algorithms utilize one or two domain-specific heuristics, which limits the amount of incorporated knowledge or treats all knowledge as equally effective. We propose a hyperheuristic approach that efficiently utilizes multiple domain-specific heuristics that incorporate knowledge from different sources by allocating computational resources to the effective ones. Furthermore, a hyperheuristic allows the simultaneous use of conventional evolutionary operators that assist in escaping local optima. This paper empirically demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed hyperheuristic approach on a multi-objective design problem for an Earth observation satellite system. Results show that the hyperheuristic approach significantly improves the search performance compared to an evolutionary algorithm that does not use any domain knowledge.</p></span></span></span></li>

This paper is devoted to computational aspects of DEA models when the determination of the least distance to the Pareto-efficient frontier is the goal. Commonly, these models have been addressed in the literature by applying unsatisfactory techniques, based essentially on combinatorial NP-hard problems. Recently, some heuristics have been introduced to solve these situations. This work improves on previous heuristics for the generation of valid solutions. More valid solutions are generated and with lower execution time. A parameterized scheme of metaheuristics is developed to improve the solutions obtained through heuristics. A hyper-heuristic is used over the parameterized scheme. The hyper-heuristic searches in a space of metaheuristics and generates metaheuristics that provide solutions close to the optimum. The method is competitive versus exact methods, and has a lower execution time.</p></span></span></span></li>

Both the yard blocks and the quay are equipped with cranes to support loading/unloading operations. In order to service more vessels, any unnecessary idle time between quay crane (QC) operations need to be minimised to speed up the container transfer process. Due to the unpredictable port situations that can affect routing plans and the short calculation time allowed to generate one, static solution methods are not suitable for this problem. In this paper, we introduce a new mathematical model that minimises both the QC makespan and the truck travelling time.

A hyper-heuristic operates on a set of predefined heuristics and applies a machine learning technique to predict which heuristic is the most effective to apply at a given point in time. Thompson Sampling is a machine learning mechanism interacting with the search environment to adapt its behaviour through trial-and-error. Despite the fact that it originated in the 1930s, the work on Thompson Sampling in the literature on search heuristics is limited. This paper is the first study investigating the Thompson Sampling approach in the field of hyper-heuristics. I propose an adaptive Thompson Sampling mechanism for hyper-heuristics and extensively evaluate its performance on a wide range of test models and combinatorial optimisation problems. The proposed algorithm is tested and compared with a large number of hyper-heuristics within a well-known competition for hyper-heuristics called CHeSC 2011.

A common issue with the application of a memetic algorithm is determining the best initial setting for the algorithmic parameters, but these can greatly influence its overall performance. Unlike traditional studies where parameters are tuned for a particular problem domain, in this study we do tuning that is applicable to cross-domain search. We extend previous work by tuning the parameters of a steady state memetic algorithm via a 'design of experiments' approach and provide surprising empirical results across nine problem domains, using a cross-domain heuristic search tool, namely HyFlex. The parameter tuning results show that tuning has value for cross-domain search. As a side gain, the results suggest that the crossover operators should not be used and, more interestingly, that single point based search should be preferred over a population based search, turning the overall approach into an iterated local search algorithm. The use of the improved parameter settings greatly enhanced the crossdomain performance of the algorithm, converting it from a poor performer in previous work to one of the stronger competitors.</p></span></span></span></li>

Several internal mechanisms for automatically adapt those parameters can be implemented, but they require extra design effort and their validation no necessarily is generalizable to multiple domains. Such effort is prohibitive for their practical application on decision-support systems. Rather than implementing internal adapting mechanisms, the exploration of automatic parameter configuration through external tools is performed in this work.

In this work, we propose a systematic method to characterize each neighborhood's behaviours, representing them as a feature vector, and using cluster analysis to form similar groups of neighborhoods. The novelty of our characterization method is the ability of reflecting changes of behaviours according to hardness of different solution quality regions based on simple statistics collected during any algorithm runs. We show that using neighborhood clusters instead of individual neighborhoods helps to reduce the parameter configuration space without misleading the search of the tuning procedure. Moreover, this method is problem-independent and potentially can be applied in similar contexts.</p></span></span></span></li>

As a first step in addressing the problem, this paper presents a new web services selection/composition model which enables such a hyper-heuristic notion. Various parts of this proposed model can be implemented by using different algorithms thus enabling many hybrid implementations. In this paper the proposed model has been implemented by using a reference score and trust based service selection algorithm and a strategic tree based service composition algorithm. To realize this implementation agent based architecture has been proposed. A well defined QOS model has been used to accurately receive customer's request and update service specific quality values. The algorithms implemented are efficient as the computational complexities of these algorithms have been greatly reduced and also a fault tolerant approach has been adopted. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed model and algorithms have effectively solved the web services selection/composition problem.</p></span></span></span></li>

These ranges are further processed to determine a portfolio of parameter configurations, which would be used within two online Algorithm Selection approaches for solving different instances of a given combinatorial optimization problem effectively. We apply our approach on a Simulated Annealing-Tabu Search (SA-TS) hybrid algorithm for solving the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) as well as an Iterated Local Search (ILS) on the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).

These construction heuristics are usually derived by humans and this is usually quite a time consuming task. Furthermore, according to the no free lunch theorem different heuristics are effective for different problem instances. Ideally we would like to derive construction heuristics for different problem instances or classes of problems. However, due to the time it takes to manually derive construction heuristics it is generally not feasible to induce problem instance specific heuristics. The research presented in the paper forms part of the initiative aimed at automating the derivation of construction heuristics. Genetic programming is used to evolve construction heuristics for the curriculum based university course timetabling (CB-CTT) problem. Each heuristic is a hierarchical combination of problem characteristics and a period selection heuristic. The paper firstly presents and analyses the performance of known construction heuristics for CB-CTT. The analysis has shown that different heuristics are effective for different problem instances. The paper then presents the genetic programming approach for the automated induction of construction heuristics for the CB-CTT problem and evaluates the approach on the ITC 2007 problem instances for the second international timetabling competition. The evolved heuristics performed better than the known construction heuristics, producing timetables with lower soft constraint costs.</p></span></span></span></li>

Unfortunately, traditional random graph models tend to produce artificial representations of real-world phenomenon. Manually developing customized random graph models for every application would require an unreasonable amount of time and effort. In this work, a platform is developed to automate the production of random graph generators that are tailored to specific applications. Elements of existing random graph generation techniques are used to create a set of graph-based primitive operations. A hyper-heuristic approach is employed that uses genetic programming to automatically construct random graph generators from this set of operations. This work improves upon similar research by increasing the level of algorithmic sophistication possible with evolved solutions, allowing more accurate modeling of subtle graph characteristics. The versatility of this approach is tested against existing methods and experimental results demonstrate the potential to outperform conventional and state of the art techniques for specific applications.</p></span></span></span></li>

The basic idea of hyper-heuristics is based on searching for search-strategy. Instead of traversing the solution-space, the hyper-heuristic traverses the space of algorithms to find or construct an algorithm best suited for the given problem instance. The observed efficiency of hyper-heuristics is not yet fully explained on the theoretical level. The leading hypothesis suggests that the fitness landscape of the algorithm-space is more favorable to local search techniques than the original space.

In this paper, we analyse properties of fitness landscapes of the problem of minimal vertex cover. We focus on properties that are related to efficiency of metaheuristics such as locality and fitness-distance correlation. We compare properties of the original space and the algorithm space trying to verify the hypothesis explaining hyper-heuristics performance. Our analysis shows that the hyper-heuristic space really has some more favorable properties than the original space.</p></span></span></span></li>

This paper focuses on a dynamic JSS problem to minimise the total weighted tardiness. In dynamic JSS, attributes of a job are only revealed after it arrives at the shop floor. Dispatching rule heuristics are prominent approaches to dynamic JSS problems, and Genetic Programming based Hyper-heuristic (GP-HH) approaches have been proposed to automatically generate effective dispatching rules for dynamic JSS problems. Research on static JSS problems shows that high quality ensembles of dispatching rules can be evolved by a GP-HH that uses cooperative coevolution. Therefore, we compare two coevolutionary GP approaches to evolve ensembles of dispatching rules for dynamic JSS problems. First, we adapt the Multilevel Genetic Programming (MLGP) approach, which has never been applied to JSS problems. Second, we extend an existing approach for a static JSS problem, called Ensemble Genetic Programming for Job Shop Scheduling (EGP-JSS), by adding "less-myopic" terminals that take job and machine attributes outside of the scope of the attributes commonly used in the literature. The results show that MLGP for JSS evolves ensembles that are significantly better than single "less-myopic" rules evolved using GP with only little difference in computation time. In addition, the rules evolved using EGP-JSS perform better than the MLGP-JSS rules, but MLGP-JSS evolves rules significantly faster than EGP-JSS.</p></span></span></span></li>

New solution methods arise from random evaluation of existing studies. Objective: The current work conducts a secondary study, aiming to systemize existing primary studies in heuristic optimization techniques applied to solving classes of RCPSPs. Method: The systemizing framework consists of performing a systematic mapping study (SM), following a 3-steped protocol. Results: 371 primary studies have been depicted from the multi-stage search and filtering process, to which inclusion and exclusion criteria have been applied. Results have been visually mapped in several distributions. Conclusions: Specific RCPSP classes have been grounded and therefore a rigorous classification is required before performing a systematic mapping.

Stochastic
tree search algorithms, like Monte Carlo Tree Search, perform relatively well on this task. However, performance is nontransitive: different agents perform best in different games, which means that there is not a single agent that is the best in all the games. Rather, some types of games are dominated by a few agents whereas other different agents dominate other types of games. Thus, it should be possible to construct a hyper-agent that selects from a portfolio, in which constituent sub-agents will play a new game best. Since there is no knowledge about the games, the agent needs to use available features to predict the most suitable algorithm. This work constructs such a hyper-agent using the General Video Game Playing Framework (GVGAI).

Structural conservation serves as strong evidence for important RNA functionality. Thus, comparative structure analysis is the gold standard for the discovery and interpretation of functional RNAs.In this paper we focus on one of the functional RNA motif types, sequence-structure motifs in RNA molecules, which marks the molecule as targets to be recognized by other molecules.We present a new approach for the detection of RNA structure (including pseudoknots), which is conserved among a set of unaligned RNA sequences. Our method extends previous approaches for this problem, which were based on first identifying conserved stems and then assembling them into complex structural motifs. The novelty of our approach is in simultaneously preforming both the identification and the assembly of these stems. We believe this novel unified approach offers a more informative model for deciphering the evolution of functional RNAs, where the sets of stems comprising a conserved motif co-evolve as a correlated functional unit.Since the task of mining RNA sequence-structure motifs can be addressed by solving the maximum weighted clique problem in an n-partite graph, we translate the maximum weighted clique problem into a state graph. Then, we gather and define domain knowledge and low-level heuristics for this domain. Finally, we learn hyper-heuristics for this domain, which can be used with heuristic search algorithms (e.g., A*, IDA*) for the mining task. The hyper-heuristics are evolved using HH-Evolver, a tool for domain-specific, hyper-heuristic evolution. Our approach is designed to overcome the computational limitations of current algorithms, and to remove the necessity of previous assumptions that were used for sparsifying the graph.This is still work in progress and as yet we have no results to report. However, given the interest in the methodology and its previous success in other domains we are hopeful that these shall be forthcoming soon.</p></span></span></span></li>

Several experimental studies have used additive reinforcement learning mechanisms, however, these are inconclusive with regard to the performance of selection hyper-heuristics with these learning mechanisms. This paper points out limitations to learning with additive reinforcement learning mechanisms. Our theoretical results show that if the probability of improving the candidate solution in each point of the search process is less than 1 / 2 which is a mild assumption, then additive reinforcement learning mechanisms perform asymptotically similar to the simple random mechanism which chooses heuristics uniformly at random. In addition, frequently used adaptation schemes can affect the memory of reinforcement learning mechanisms negatively. We also conducted experiments on two well-known combinatorial optimisation problems, bin-packing and flow-shop, and the obtained results confirm the theoretical findings. This study suggests that alternatives to the additive updates in reinforcement learning mechanisms should be considered.</p></span></span></span></li>

The results presented are comparable to those generated by state-of-the-art metaheuristics, as  well as a single-objective version of the algorithm from the literature. The information revealed from analysing  the sequences generated to solve the problem reveal important information about the nature of the problem space  that is not available from the metaheuristics, and the entire Pareto front can be explored in a single run as opposed  to the multiple runs needed with the original single-objective algorithm.</p></span></span></span></li>

The MOSSHH algorithm operates as a hidden Markov model, using transition probabilities to determine which low-level heuristic or sequence of heuristics should be applied next. By incorporating dominance into the transition probability update rule, and an elite archive of solutions, MOSSHH generates solutions to multi-objective problems that are competitive with bespoke multi-objective algorithms. When applied to test problems, it is able to find good approximations to the true Pareto front, and yields information about the type of low-level heuristics that it uses to solve the problem.</p></span></span></span></li>

Evolving ensembles using GP-HH for DJSS problem is a relatively unexplored area, and has been shown to outperform standard GP-HH procedures that evolve single rules. As a fitness sharing algorithm has not been applied to the specific GP-HH approach, we investigate four different phenotypic distance measures as part of a fitness sharing algorithm. The fitness sharing algorithm may potentially improve the diversity of the constituent members of the ensemble and improve the quality of the ensembles. The results show that the niched coevolutionary GP approaches evolve smaller sized rules than the base coevolutionary GP approaches, but have similar performances.</p></span></span></span></li>

Robots executing OHE use the different sources of feedback information traditionally associated with controller evaluation to find effective evolutionary algorithms and controllers online during task execution. We present two approaches: OHE-fitness, which uses the fitness score of controllers as the criterion to select promising algorithms over time, and OHE-diversity, which relies on the behavioural diversity of controllers for algorithm selection. Both OHE-fitness and OHE-diversity are distributed across groups of robots that evolve in parallel. We assess the performance of OHE-fitness and of OHE-diversity in two foraging tasks with differing complexity, and in five configurations of a dynamic phototaxis task with varying evolutionary pressures. Results show that our OHE approaches: (i) outperform multiple state-of-the-art algorithms as they facilitate controllers with superior performance and faster evolution of solutions, and (ii) can increase effectiveness at different stages of evolution by combining the benefits of multiple algorithms over time. Overall, our study shows that OHE is an effective new paradigm to the synthesis of controllers for robots.</p></span></span></span></li>

To reduce execution times, a shared-memory schema of hyperheuristics is used, with four levels of parallelism, with two being selected for the hyperheuristic and two for the metaheuristics. The parallel schema is executed in a many-core system in "native mode", and the four-level parallelism allows us to take full advantage of the massive parallelism offered by this architecture. An auto-tuning methodology is used to select the number of threads used at each level. A theoretical model of the execution time of the parameterized metaheuristic schema is developed, and the model is adapted to a particular metaheuristic by experimentation. The massive parallelism in a many-core system can help to obtain satisfactory fitness and an important reduction in execution times, for which the four-levels parallelism schema is useful, and the auto-tuning engine facilitates the optimum selection of the number of threads at each level. The best results are obtained with a relatively low number of threads distributed among the four levels of parallelism between the hyper and metaheuristics.</p></span></span></span></li>

We focus particularly on evolving energy-aware dispatching rules in the form of genetic programs that can schedule jobs for the purpose of minimizing total energy consumption, makespan and total tardiness in a job shop. To improve the opportunity of identifying desirable dispatching rules, we have also explored several alternative topologies of the island model.

HyFlex is a general purpose heuristic search API which separates the high level search control from the domain details enabling rapid development and performance comparison of heuristic search methods, particularly hyper-heuristics. In this study, the performance of six previously proposed selection hyper-heuristics are evaluated on three recently introduced extended HyFlex problem domains, namely 0-1 Knapsack, Quadratic Assignment and Max-Cut.

Previous work mainly focuses on empirical study, while theoretical study, particularly in multi-objective optimization, is largely insufficient. In this paper, we use three main components of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (selection mechanisms, mutation operators, acceptance strategies) as low-level heuristics, respectively, and prove that using heuristic selection (i.e., mixing low-level heuristics) can be exponentially faster than using only one low-level heuristic. Our result provides theoretical support for multi-objective selection hyper-heuristics, and might be helpful for designing efficient heuristic selection methods in practice.</p></span></span></span></li>

Here we investigate two frameworks, using Harmony Search to select a mixture of continuous and discrete variables forming the components of a Memetic Algorithm for cross-domain heuristic search. The first is a single-point based framework which maintains a single solution, updating the harmony memory based on performance from a fixed starting position. The second is a population-based method which co-evolves a set of solutions to a problem alongside a set of harmony vectors. This work examines the behaviour of each framework over thirty problem instances taken from six different, real-world problem domains. The results suggest that population co-evolution performs better in a time-constrained scenario, however both approaches are ultimately constrained by the underlying metaphors.</p></span></span></span></li>

Instead, we model this as a dynamic pickup and delivery problem with soft time windows (PDPSTW). We present the variable neighbourhood descent with memory (VNDM) hybrid metaheuristic (HM) and compare its performance against Q-learning (QL), binary exponential back off (BEBO) and random descent (RD) hyperheuristics on published benchmark and real-world instances of the PDPSTW. We find that VNDM consistently generates the highest quality solutions, with the fewest routes or shortest distances, amongst the methods tested.

Synchronous Parallel EAs (SPEAs) leverage this with the intent to gain significant speed-ups when executed on multiple processors. However, many important problem classes lead to large variations in fitness evaluation times, such as is often the case in hyper-heuristics where the time complexity of executing one individual may differ greatly from that of another. Asynchronous Parallel EAs (APEAs) omit the generational synchronization step of traditional EAs which work in well-defined cycles. They can provide scalability improvements proportional to the variation in fitness evaluation times of the evolved individuals, and therefore should be considered for use in hyper-heuristics. This paper provides an empirical analysis of the improvements obtained by applying APEAs, compared to SPEAs, on a case study involving the evolution of conflict-driven clause learning Boolean satisfiability solvers, demonstrating that APEAs are the future of hyper-heuristics.</p></span></span></span></li>

As an alternative, meta-heuristics emerged as an efficient way to solve this type of problems even though they cannot ensure optimal values. The main issue of meta-heuristics is that they are built using domain-specific knowledge, therefore they require a great effort to be used in a new domain. In order to solve this problem, the concept of Hyper-heuristics were proposed. Hyper-heuristics are search methods that aim to solve optimization problems by selecting or generating heuristics. Selection hyper-heuristics choose from a pool of heuristics a good one to be applied at the current stage of the optimization process. The selection mechanism is the main part of a selection hyper-heuristic and has a great impact on its performance. Although there are several works focused on selection hyperheuristics, there is no unanimity about which is the best way to define a selection strategy. In this dissertation, a deterministic selection strategy based on the concepts of the MultiArmed Bandit (MAB) problem is proposed to cross-domain optimization. Multi-armed bandit approaches define a selection function with two components, the first is based on the performance of an operator and the second based on the number of times that the operator was used. These approaches had showed a promising performance over the Adaptive Operator Selection context. However, there are few works on literature that aim the hyper-heuristic context, as proposed here. The proposed approach is integrated into the HyFlex framework, that was developed to facilitate the implementation and comparison of hyper-heuristics. An empirical parameter configuration was performed and the best setup was compared to the top ten CHeSC 2011 algorithms using the same methodology adopted during the competition. The results obtained were good comparable to those attained by the literature. Moreover, it was concluded that the behavior of MAB selection is heavily affected by its parameters. As this is not a desirable behavior to hyper-heuristics, future research will investigate ways to better deal with the parameter setting.</p></span></span></span></li>

Current conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) SAT solvers employ all-purpose heuristics for making decisions when finding truth assignments for arbitrary logical expressions called SAT instances. The instances derived from a particular problem class exhibit a unique underlying structure which impacts a solver's effectiveness. Thus, tailoring the solver heuristics to a particular problem class can significantly enhance the solver's performance; however, manual specialization is very labor intensive. Automated development may apply hyper-heuristics to search program space by utilizing problem-derived building blocks. This thesis demonstrates the potential for genetic programming (GP) powered hyper-heuristic driven automated design of algorithms to create tailored CDCL solvers, in this case through custom variable scoring and learnt clause scoring heuristics, with significantly better performance on targeted classes of SAT problem instances. As the run-time of GP is often dominated by fitness evaluation, evaluating multiple offspring in parallel typically reduces the time incurred by fitness evaluation proportional to the number of parallel processing units. The naive synchronous approach requires an entire generation to be evaluated before progressing to the next generation; as such, heterogeneity in the evaluation times will degrade the performance gain, as parallel processing units will have to idle until the longest evaluation has completed. This thesis shows empirical evidence justifying the employment of an asynchronous parallel model for GP powered hyper-heuristics applied to SAT solver space, rather than the generational synchronous alternative, for gaining speed-ups in evolution time. Additionally, this thesis explores the use of a multi-objective GP to reveal the trade-off surface between multiple CDCL attributes.</p></span></span></span></li>

The objective of these algorithms is not only to find suitable adjustments to the current population and hence the solution, but also to perform the process efficiently. However, a parameter setting that was optimal at the beginning of the algorithm may become unsuitable during the evolutionary process. Thus, it is preferable to automatically modify the control parameters during the runtime process. The approach required could have a bias on the distribution towards appropriate directions of the search space, thereby maintaining sufficient diversity among individuals in order to enable further ability of evolution. This thesis has offered an initial approach to developing this idea. The work starts from a clear understanding of the literature that is of direct relevance to the aforementioned motivations. The development of this approach has been built upon the basis of the fundamental and generic concepts of evolutionary algorithms. The work has exploited and benefited from a range of representative evolutionary computational mechanisms. In particular, essential issues in evolutionary algorithms such as parameter control, including the general aspects of parameter tuning and typical means for implementing parameter control have been investigated. Both the hyperheuristic algorithm and the memetic algorithm have set up a comparative work for the present development. This work has developed several novel techniques that contribute towards the advancement of evolutionary computation and optimization. One such novel approach is to construct a mixed strategy based on the concept of local fitness landscape. It exploits the concepts of fitness landscape and local fitness landscape. Both theoretical description and experimental investigation of this local fitness landscape-based mixed strategy have been provided, and systematic comparisons with alternative approaches carried out. Another contribution of this thesis is the innovative application of mixed strategy. This is facilitated by encompassing two mutation operators into the mixed strategy, which are borrowed from classical differential evolution techniques. Such an improved method has been shown to be simple and easy for implementation. The work has been utilised to deal with the problem of protein folding in bioinformatics. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm possesses an appropriate balance between exploration and exploitation. The use of this improved algorithm is less likely to fall into local optimal, entailing a faster and better convergence in resolving challenging realistic application problems.</p></span></span></span></li>

A job shop is a common manufacturing environment in which a schedule for processing a set of jobs through a set of machines needs to be constructed. Job shop scheduling (JSS) has been called a fascinating challenge as it is computationally hard and prevalent in the real-world. Developing more effective ways of scheduling jobs could increase profitability through increasing throughput and decreasing costs. Dispatching rules (DRs) are one of the most popular scheduling heuristics. DRs are easy to implement, have low computational cost, and cope well with the dynamic nature of real-world manufacturing environments.  However, the manual development of DRs is time consuming and requires expert knowledge of the scheduling environment. Genetic programming (GP) is an evolutionary computation method which is ideal for automatically discovering DRs. This is a hyper-heuristic approach, as GP is searching the search space of heuristic (DR) solutions rather than constructing a schedule directly.

The overall goal of this thesis is to develop GP based hyper-heuristics for the efficient evolution (automatic generation) of robust, reusable and effective scheduling heuristics for JSS environments, with greater interpretability.

Firstly, this thesis investigates using GP to evolve optimal DRs for the static two-machine JSS problem with makespan objective function. The results show that some evolved DRs were equivalent to an optimal scheduling algorithm. This validates both the GP based hyper-heuristic approach for generating DRs for JSS and the representation used.

Secondly, this thesis investigates developing "less-myopic" DRs through the use of wider-looking terminals and local search to provide additional fitness information. The results show that incorporating features of the state of the wider shop improves the mean performance of the best evolved DRs, and that the inclusion of local search in evaluation evolves DRs which make better decisions over the local time horizon, and attain lower total weighted tardiness.

Thirdly, this thesis proposes using strongly typed GP (STGP) to address the challenging issue of interpretability of DRs evolved by GP. Several grammars are investigated and the results show that the DRs evolved in the semantically constrained search space of STGP do not have (on average) performance that is as good as unconstrained. However, the interpretability of evolved rules is substantially improved.

Fourthly, this thesis investigates using multiobjective GP to encourage evolution of DRs which are more readily interpretable by human operators.  This approach evolves DRs with similar performance but smaller size. Fragment analysis identifies popular combinations of terminals which are then used as high level terminals; the inclusion of these terminals improved the mean performance of the best evolved DRs.

Through this thesis the following major contributions have been made: (1) the first use of GP to evolve optimal DRs for the static two-machine job shop with makespan objective function; (2) an approach to developing less-myopic DRs through the inclusion of wider looking terminals and the use of local search to provide additional fitness information over an extended decision horizon; (3) the first use of STGP for the automatic discovery of DRs with better interpretability and semantic validity for increased trust; and (4) the first multiobjective GP approach that considers multiple objectives  investigating the trade-off between scheduling behaviour and interpretability. This is also the first work that uses analysis of evolved GP individuals to perform feature selection and construction for JSS.</p></span></span></span></li>

This problem has many different applications such as mobile phones, TV broadcasting, radio and military operations. In this thesis, two variants of the FAP are considered, namely the static and the dynamic FAPs. The static FAP does not change over time, while the dynamic FAP changes over time as new requests gradually be-come known and frequencies need to be assigned to those requests effectively and promptly. The dynamic FAP has received little attention so far in the literature com-pared with the static FAP.

This thesis consists of two parts: the first part discusses and develops three heuristic algorithms, namely tabu search (TS), ant colony optimization (ACO) and hyper heuris-tic (HH), to solve the static FAP. These heuristic algorithms are chosen to represent different characteristics of heuristic algorithms in order to identify an appropriate solu-tion method for this problem. Several novel and existing techniques have been used to improve the performance of these heuristic algorithms. In terms of TS, one of the nov-el techniques aims to determine a lower bound on the number of frequencies that are required from each domain for a feasible solution to exist, based on the underlying graph colouring model. These lower bounds are used to ensure that we never waste time trying to find a feasible solution with a set of frequencies that do not satisfy the lower bounds, since there is no feasible solution in this search area. Another novel technique hybridises TS with multiple neighbourhood structures, one of which is used as a diversification technique. In terms of ACO, the concept of a well-known graph colouring algorithm, namely recursive largest first, is used. Moreover, some of the key factors in producing a high quality ACO implementation are examined such as differ-ent definitions of visibility and trail, and optimization of numerous parameters. In terms of HH, simple and advanced low level heuristics each with an associated inde-pendent tabu list are applied in this study. The lower bound on the number of fre-quencies that are required from each domain for a feasible solution to exist is also used.

Based on the experimental results, it is found that the best performing heuristic algo-rithm is TS, with HH also being competitive, whereas ACO achieves poor perfor-mance. Additionally, TS shows competitive performance compared with other algo-rithms in the literature.

In the second part of this thesis, various approaches are designed to solve the dynamic FAP. The best heuristic algorithms considered in the first part of this thesis are used to construct these approaches. It is interesting to investigate whether heuristic algorithms which work well on the static FAP also prove efficient on the dynamic FAP. Addi-tionally, several techniques are applied to improve the performance of these approach-es. One of these, called the Gap technique, is novel. This technique aims to identify a good frequency to be assigned to a given request. Based on the experimental results, it is found that the best approach for the dynamic FAP shows competitive results com-pared with other approaches in the literature. Finally, this thesis proposes a novel ap-proach to solve the static FAP by modelling it as a dynamic FAP through dividing this problem into smaller sub-problems, which are then solved in turn in a dynamic process. The lower bound on the number of frequencies that are required from each domain for a feasible solution to exist, based on the underlying graph colouring model, and the Gap technique are also used. The proposed approach shows the ability to improve the results which have been found by the heuristic algorithms in the first part of this thesis (which solve the static FAP as a whole). Moreover, it shows competitive results com-pared with other algorithms in the literature.</p></span></span></span></li>

Selecting a good combination of leader and archiving methods helps the algorithm to deal with the challenges caused by this increase in the number of objectives, but finding the most appropriate combination for a given problem is a hard task. To deal with this issue, previous works proposed the use of a simple hyper-heuristic to select dynamically a good combination of leader and archiving methods and achieved promising results. In this work, we hypothesize that by using more advanced heuristic selection methods we could further improve the performance of the algorithm. To investigate this hypothesis we conducted experimental studies comparing four heuristic selection methods. After selecting the best performing variant from this study, we conducted a second empirical study to compare this variant to a state-of-the- art optimizer, where the resulting algorithm outperformed it in most of the problems investigated.</p></span></span></span></li>

The alternative way is either using metaheuristics or matheuristics that rely on exact methods in some ways. In the context of combinatorial optimization, we are interested in heuristics to choose heuristics invoked to solve the addressed problem. In this thesis, we focus on hyperheuristic optimization in logistic problems. We focus on proposing a hyperheuristic framework that carries out a search in the space of heuristic algorithms and learns how to change the incumbent heuristic in a systematic way along the process in such a way that a good sequence of heuristics produces high quality solutions. We propose HHs for two problems in logistics: the workover rig scheduling problem and the hub location routing problem. Then, we compare the performances of several HHs described in the literature for the latter problem, which embed different heuristic selection methods such as a random selection, a choice function, a Q-Learning approach, and an ant colony based algorithm. The computational results prove the efficiency of HHs for the two problems in hand, and the relevance of including Lagrangian relaxation information for the second problem.</p></span></span></span></li>

A traditional hyper-heuristic framework has two levels, namely, the high level strategy (heuristic selection mechanism and the acceptance criterion) and low level heuristics (a set of problem specific heuristics). Due to the different landscape structures of different problem instances, the high level strategy plays an important role in the design of a hyper-heuristic framework. In this paper, we propose a new high level strategy for a hyper-heuristic framework. The proposed high-level strategy utilizes a dynamic multiarmed bandit-extreme value-based reward as an online heuristic selection mechanism to select the appropriate heuristic to be applied at each iteration. In addition, we propose a gene expression programming framework to automatically generate the acceptance criterion for each problem instance, instead of using human-designed criteria. Two well-known, and very different, combinatorial optimization problems, one static (exam timetabling) and one dynamic (dynamic vehicle routing) are used to demonstrate the generality of the proposed framework. Compared with state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics and other bespoke methods, empirical results demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to generalize well across both domains. We obtain competitive, if not better results, when compared to the best known results obtained from other methods that have been presented in the scientific literature. We also compare our approach against the recently released hyper-heuristic competition test suite. We again demonstrate the generality of our approach when we compare against other methods that have utilized the same six benchmark datasets from this test suite.</p></span></span></span></li>

Selection hyper-heuristics are high level general purpose search methodologies that operate on a space formed by a set of low level heuristics rather than solutions. Most of the recently proposed selection hyper-heuristics are iterative and make use of two key methods which are employed successively; heuristic selection and move acceptance.

In this study, we present a novel generic selection hyper-heuristic framework containing a fixed set of reusable grouping low level heuristics and an unconventional move acceptance mechanism for solving grouping problems. This framework deals with one solution at a time at any given decision point during the search process. Also, a set of high quality solutions, capturing the trade-off between the number of groups and the additional objective for the given grouping problem, is maintained. The move acceptance mechanism embeds a local search approach which is capable of progressing improvements on those trade-off solutions.

The performance of different selection hyper-heuristics with various components under the proposed framework is investigated on graph colouring as a representative grouping problem. Then, the top performing hyper-heuristics are applied to a benchmark of examination timetabling instances. The empirical results indicate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed framework enabling grouping hyper-heuristics to achieve high quality solutions in both domains.</p></span></span></span></li>

Growth of Resource provisioning-based scheduling in large-scale distributed environments like Grid computing brings in new requirement challenges that are not being considered in traditional distributed computing environments. Resources being the backbone of the system, their efficient management plays quite an important role in its execution environment. Many constraints such as heterogeneity and dynamic nature of resources need to be taken care as steps toward managing Grid resources efficiently. The most important challenge in Grids being the job-resource mapping as per the users' requirement in the most secure way. The mapping of the jobs to appropriate resources for execution of the applications in Grid computing is found to be an NP-complete problem. Novel algorithm is required to schedule the jobs on the resources to provide reduced execution time, increased security and reliability. The main aim of this paper is to present an efficient strategy for secure scheduling of jobs on appropriate resources. A novel particle swarm optimization-based hyper-heuristic resource scheduling algorithm has been designed and used to schedule jobs effectively on available resources without violating any of the security norms. Performance of the proposed algorithm has also been evaluated through the GridSim toolkit. We have compared our resource scheduling algorithm with existing common heuristic-based scheduling algorithms experimentally. The results thus obtained have shown a better performance by our algorithm than the existing algorithms, in terms of giving more reduced cost and makespan of user's application being submitted to the Grids.</p></span></span></span></li>

The system continuously generates new heuristics and samples problems from its environment; and representative problems and heuristics are incorporated into a self-sustaining network of interacting entities inspired by methods in artificial immune systems. The network is plastic in both its structure and content, leading to the following properties: it exploits existing knowledge captured in the network to rapidly produce solutions; it can adapt to new problems with widely differing characteristics; and it is capable of generalising over the problem space. The system is tested on a large corpus of 3,968 new instances of 1D bin-packing problems as well as on 1,370 existing problems from the literature; it shows excellent performance in terms of the quality of solutions obtained across the datasets and in adapting to dynamically changing sets of problem instances compared to previous approaches. As the network self-adapts to sustain a minimal repertoire of both problems and heuristics that form a representative map of the problem space, the system is further shown to be computationally efficient and therefore scalable.</p></span></span></span></li>

- The examination timetabling problem is an NP-hard problem. A large number of approaches for this problem are developed to find more appropriate search strategies. Hyper-heuristic is a kind of representative methods. In hyper-heuristic, the high-level search is executed to construct heuristic lists by traditional methods (such as Tabu search, variable neighborhoods and so on). The purpose of this paper is to apply the evolutionary strategy instead of traditional methods for high-level search to improve the capability of global search.

Design/methodology/approach
- This paper combines hyper-heuristic with evolutionary strategy to solve examination timetabling problems. First, four graph coloring heuristics are employed to construct heuristic lists. Within the evolutionary algorithm framework, the iterative initialization is utilized to improve the number of feasible solutions in the population; meanwhile, the crossover and mutation operators are applied to find potential heuristic lists in the heuristic space (high-level search). At last, two local search methods are combined to optimize the feasible solutions in the solution space (low-level search).

Findings
- Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach obtains competitive results and outperforms the compared approaches on some benchmark instances.

Originality/value
- The contribution of this paper is the development of a framework which combines evolutionary algorithm and hyper-heuristic for examination timetabling problems.</p></span></span></span></li>

A generic selection hyper-heuristic combines heuristic selection and move acceptance methods under an iterative single point-based search framework. At each step, the solution in hand is modified after applying a selected heuristic and a decision is made whether the new solution is accepted or not. In this study, we represent the trail of a hyper-heuristic as a third order tensor. Factorization of such a tensor reveals the latent relationships between the low level heuristics and the hyper-heuristic itself. The proposed learning approach partitions the set of low level heuristics into two subsets where heuristics in each subset are associated with a separate move acceptance method. Then a multi-stage hyper-heuristic is formed and while solving a given problem instance, heuristics are allowed to operate only in conjunction with the associated acceptance method at each stage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time tensor analysis of the space of heuristics is used as a data science approach to improve the performance of a hyper-heuristic in the prescribed manner. The empirical results across six different problem domains from a benchmark indeed indicate the success of the proposed approach.</p></span></span></span></li>

Based on a set of low-level heuristics (or strategies), a hyperheuristic game player can generate strategies which adapt to both the behavior of the co-players and the game dynamics. By using a simple heuristic selection mechanism, a number of existing heuristics for specialized games can be integrated into an automated game player. As examples, we develop hyperheuristic game players for three games: iterated prisoner's dilemma, repeated Goofspiel and the competitive traveling salesmen problem. The results demonstrate that a hyperheuristic game player outperforms the low-level heuristics, when used individually in game playing and it can generate adaptive strategies even if the low-level heuristics are deterministic. This methodology provides an efficient way to develop new strategies for games based on existing strategies.</p></span></span></span></li>

A transportation schedule must be constructed for a set of available vehicles, and several constraints have to be considered, particularly time windows, which define an upper and lower time bound for each customer request in which a vehicle must arrive to perform the service. Because of the complexity of DARPTW, a number of algorithms have been proposed for solving the problem, mainly based on metaheuristics such as Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing. In this work, a different approach for solving DARPTW is proposed, designed, and evaluated: hyperheuristics, which are alternative heuristic methods that operate at a higher abstraction level than metaheuristics, because rather than searching in the problem space directly, they search in a space of low-level heuristics to find the best strategy through which good solutions can be found. Although the proposed hyperheuristic uses simple and easy-to-implement operators, the experimental results demonstrate efficient and competitive performance on DARPTW when compared to other metaheuristics from the literature.</p></span></span></span></li>

Hyper-heuristics accomplish this through a high-level heuristic (heuristic selection mechanism and an acceptance criterion). This automates heuristic selection, deciding whether to accept or reject the returned solution. The fact that different problems, or even instances, have different landscape structures and complexity, the design of efficient high-level heuristics can have a dramatic impact on hyper-heuristic performance. In this paper, instead of using human knowledge to design the high-level heuristic, we propose a gene expression programming algorithm to automatically generate, during the instance-solving process, the high-level heuristic of the hyper-heuristic framework. The generated heuristic takes information (such as the quality of the generated solution and the improvement made) from the current problem state as input and decides which low-level heuristic should be selected and the acceptance or rejection of the resultant solution. The benefit of this framework is the ability to generate, for each instance, different high-level heuristics during the problem-solving process. Furthermore, in order to maintain solution diversity, we utilize a memory mechanism that contains a population of both high-quality and diverse solutions that is updated during the problem-solving process. The generality of the proposed hyper-heuristic is validated against six well-known combinatorial optimization problems, with very different landscapes, provided by the HyFlex software. Empirical results, comparing the proposed hyper-heuristic with state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics, conclude that the proposed hyper-heuristic generalizes well across all domains and achieves competitive, if not superior, results for several instances on all domains.</p></span></span></span></li>

This problem has been addressed by a competition, and associated set of benchmark instances, as a part of the MISTA 2013 conference. A critical aspect of the benchmarks is that the primary objective is to minimise the sum of the project completion times, with the usual makespan minimisation as a secondary objective. We observe that this leads to an expected different overall structure of good solutions and discuss the effects this has on the algorithm design. This paper presents the resulting competition winning approach; it is a carefully designed hybrid of Monte-Carlo tree search, novel neighbourhood moves, memetic algorithms, and hyper-heuristic methods. The implementation is also engineered to increase the speed with which iterations are performed, and to exploit the computing power of multicore machines. The resulting information-sharing multi-component algorithm significantly outperformed the other approaches during the competition, producing the best solution for 17 out of the 20 test instances and performing the best in around 90% of all the trials.</p></span></span></span></li>

We propose a graph-based hyper-heuristic method composed of two level heuristics: the high level heuristic and a set of low level heuristics. A sequence of graph-based low level heuristics is generated to guide the channel assignment process, and then searching in the heuristic space by the high level heuristic obtains the best channel scheduling scheme.

Early detection of lung cancer is the leading factor in survival rate. All symptoms (features) of lung cancer do not appear until the cancer spreads to other areas. It needs an accurate early detection of lung cancer, for increasing the survival rate. For accurate detection, it need characterizes efficient features and delete redundancy features among all features. Feature selection is the problem of selecting informative features among all features. Materials and Methods: Lung cancer database consist of 32 patient records with 57 features. This database collected by Hong and Youngand indexed in the University of California Irvine repository. Experimental contents include the extracted from the clinical data and X-ray data, etc. The data described 3 types of pathological lung cancers and all features are taking an integer value 0-3. In our study, new method is proposed for identify efficient features of lung cancer. It is based on Hyper-Heuristic. Results: We obtained an accuracy of 80.63% using reduced 11 feature set. The proposed method compare to the accuracy of 5 machine learning feature selections. The accuracy of these 5 methods are 60.94, 57.81, 68.75, 60.94 and 68.75. Conclusions: The proposed method has better performance with the highest level of accuracy. Therefore, the proposed model is recommended for identifying an efficient symptom of Disease. These finding are very important in health research, particularly in allocation of medical resources for patients who predicted as high-risks.</p></span></span></span></li>

Design of such rules is usually done by experts in a time consuming trial-and-error process. Recently, evolutionary algorithms have been proposed to automate the design process. There are several possibilities to represent rules for this hyper-heuristic search. Because the representation determines the search neighborhood and the complexity of the rules that can be evolved, a suitable choice of representation is key for a successful evolutionary algorithm. In this paper we empirically compare three different representations, both numeric and symbolic, for automated rule design: A linear combination of attributes, a representation based on artificial neural networks, and a tree representation. Using appropriate evolutionary algorithms (CMA-ES for the neural network and linear representations, genetic programming for the tree representation), we empirically investigate the suitability of each representation in a dynamic stochastic job shop scenario. We also examine the robustness of the evolved dispatching rules against variations in the underlying job shop scenario, and visualize what the rules do, in order to get an intuitive understanding of their inner workings. Results indicate that the tree representation using an improved version of genetic programming gives the best results if many candidate rules can be evaluated, closely followed by the neural network representation that already leads to good results for small to moderate computational budgets. The linear representation is found to be competitive only for extremely small computational budgets.</p></span></span></span></li>

We divide the experimental scheme into two distinct scenarios: (1) evolving a decision-tree induction algorithm from multiple balanced data sets; and (2) evolving a decision-tree induction algorithm from multiple imbalanced data sets. In each of these scenarios, we analyse the difference in performance of well-known classification performance measures such as accuracy, F-Measure, AUC, recall, and also a lesser-known criterion, namely the relative accuracy improvement. In addition, we analyse different schemes of aggregation, such as simple average, median, and harmonic mean. Finally, we verify whether the best-performing fitness functions are capable of providing HEAD-DT with algorithms more effective than traditional decision-tree induction algorithms like C4.5, CART, and REPTree. Experimental results indicate that HEAD-DT is a good option for generating algorithms tailored to (im)balanced data, since it outperforms state-of-the-art decision-tree induction algorithms with statistical significance.</p></span></span></span></li>

The modelling of the shared-memory scheme is considered for both types of algorithms, and a first study of message-passing metaheuristic schemes is introduced. A theoretical model of the execution time of a parametrized metaheuristic scheme is empirically adapted for a particular metaheuristic through experimentation. The parallelization of the shared-memory scheme is achieved through the independent parallelization of the basic functions in the metaheuristic scheme. The model is used to decide at running time the number of threads to obtain a reduced execution time. The number of threads is different for the different basic functions in the scheme, and depends on the problem to be solved, the metaheuristic or hyperheuristic scheme, the implementation of the basic functions and the computational system where the problem is solved. The auto-tuning methodology for shared-memory parametrized metaheuristic schemes can in turn be applied to shared-memory hyperheuristics developed on top of them. In the case of the message-passing scheme, an island model implemented with the master-slave scheme is used, and new metaheuristic-parallelism parameters representing the migration frequency, the size of the migration and the number of processes are introduced. The applicability of the proposal is shown with a minimization of electricity consumption in exploitation of wells problem and with the problem of obtaining satisfactory metaheuristics for that problem. Experimental results with these two problems show that satisfactory execution times can be achieved in metaheuristics with auto-tuning techniques based on theoretical-empirical models of the execution time.</p></span></span></span></li>

A traditional hyper-heuristic framework has two levels, a high level strategy and a set of low level heuristics. The role of the high level strategy is to decide which low level heuristic should be executed at the current decision point. This paper proposes a Monte Carlo tree search hyper-heuristic framework. We model the search space of the low level heuristics as a tree and use Monte Carlo tree search to search through the tree in order to identify the best sequence of low level heuristics to be applied to the current state. To improve the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we couple it with a memory mechanism which contains a population of solutions, utilizing different population updating rules. The generality of the proposed framework is demonstrated using the six domains of the hyper-heuristic competition (CHeSC) test suite (boolean satisfiability (MAX-SAT), one dimensional bin packing, permutation flow shop, personnel scheduling, traveling salesman and vehicle routing with time windows). The results demonstrate that the proposed hyper-heuristic generalizes well over all six domains and obtains competitive, if not better results, when compared to the best known results that have previously been presented in the scientific literature.</p></span></span></span></li>

Several heuristics have been proposed for the solution of 2DBPP but it has not been possible to find the exact solutions for large problem instances. Next fit, first fit, best fit, unified tabu search, genetic and memetic algorithms are some of the state-of-the-art methods successfully applied to this important problem. In this study, we propose a set of novel hyper-heuristic algorithms that select/combine the state-of-the-art heuristics and local search techniques for minimizing the number of 2D bins. The proposed algorithms introduce new crossover and mutation operators for the selection of the heuristics.

Solving a high school timetabling problem requires scheduling of resources and events into time slots subject to a set of constraints. Recently, an international competition, referred to as ITC 2011 was organised to determine the state-of-the-art approach for high school timetabling. The problem instances, obtained from eight different countries across the world used in this competition became a benchmark for further research in the field. Selection hyper-heuristics are general-purpose improvement methodologies that control/mix a given set of low level heuristics during the search process. In this study, we evaluate the performance of a range of selection hyper-heuristics combining different reusable components for high school timetabling. The empirical results show the success of the approach which embeds an adaptive great-deluge move acceptance method on the ITC 2011 benchmark instances. This selection hyper-heuristic ranks the second among the previously proposed approaches including the ones competed at ITC 2011.</p></span></span></span></li>

Hyper-heuristics automate the design of algorithms for a particular scenario, making them a good match for real-world problem solving. For instance, hardware model checking induced Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) instances have a very specific distribution which general SAT solvers are not necessarily well targeted to. Hyper-heuristics can automate the design of a SAT solver customized to a specific distribution of SAT instances.

The first step in employing a hyper-heuristic is creating a set of algorithmic primitives appropriate for tackling a specific problem class. The second step is searching the associated algorithmic primitive space. Hyper-heuristics have typically employed Genetic Programming (GP) to execute the second step, but even in GP there are many alternatives. This paper reports on an investigation of the relationship between the choice of GP type and the performance obtained by a hyper-heuristic employing it. Results are presented on SAT, demonstrating the existence of problems for which there is a statistically significant performance differential between the use of different GP types.</p></span></span></span></li>

However, skilled software engineers waste significant effort designing such algorithms for a particular problem, adapting them, selecting operators and configuring parameters. Hyper-heuristics can help in these tasks by dynamically selecting or creating heuristics. Despite of such advantages, we observe a lack of works regarding this subject in the SBSE field. Considering this fact, this work introduces HITO, a Hyper-heuristic for the Integration and Test Order Problem. It includes a set of well-defined steps and is based on two selection functions (Choice Function and Multi-armed Bandit) to select the best low-level heuristic (combination of mutation and crossover operators) in each mating. To perform the selection, a quality measure is proposed to assess the performance of low-level heuristics throughout the evolutionary process. HITO was implemented using NSGA-II and evaluated to solve the integration and test order problem in seven systems. The introduced hyper-heuristic obtained the best results for all systems, when compared to a traditional algorithm.</p></span></span></span></li>

Traditional iterative selection hyper-heuristics rely on two key components, a heuristic selection method and a move acceptance criterion. Choice Function heuristic selection scores heuristics based on a combination of three measures, selecting the heuristic with the highest score. Modified Choice Function heuristic selection is a variant of the Choice Function which emphasises intensification over diversification within the heuristic search process. Previous work has shown that improved results are possible in some problem domains when using Modified Choice Function heuristic selection over the classic Choice Function, however in most of these cases crossover low-level heuristics (operators) are omitted. In this paper, we introduce crossover low-level heuristics into a Modified Choice Function selection hyper-heuristic and present results over six problem domains. It is observed that although on average there is an increase in performance when using crossover low-level heuristics, the benefit of using crossover can vary on a per-domain or per-instance basis.</p></span></span></span></li>

The proposed method is tested on the well known hyper-heuristic benchmark problems within the CHeSC 2011 competition and compared with a large number of algorithms in this domain. The empirical results show that the proposed hyper-heuristic is able to outperform the current best-in-class hyper-heuristic on these problems with minimal parameter tuning and so points the way to a new field of sequence-based selection hyper-heuristics.</p></span></span></span></li>

This study presented a math-hyper-heuristic approach to tackle this problem more effectively and more efficiently. The proposed approach consists of two phases: a math phase and a hyper-heuristic phase. In the math phase, the problem is decomposed into sub-problems which are solved independently using the column generation algorithm. The solutions for these sub-problems are combined and then improved by the hyper-heuristic phase. Benchmark instances of large-scale vehicle routing problems with time windows were used for evaluation. The results show the effectiveness of the math phase.

A limited number of these portfolio studies focus on generating different versions of a target algorithm using different parameter configurations. In this paper, we employ a Design of Experiments (DOE) approach to determine a promising range of values for each parameter of an algorithm. These ranges are further processed to determine a portfolio of parameter configurations, which would be used within two online Algorithm Selection approaches for solving different instances of a given combinatorial optimization problem effectively. We apply our approach on a Simulated Annealing-Tabu Search (SA-TS) hybrid algorithm for solving the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) as well as an Iterated Local Search (ILS) on the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). We also generate a portfolio of parameter configurations using best-of-breed parameter tuning approaches directly for the comparison purpose.

However, adapting and configuring these algorithms for a specific problem can demand significant effort from software engineers. Therefore, to help in this task, a hyper-heuristic, named HITO (Hyper-heuristic for the Integration and Test Order problem) was proposed to adaptively select search operators during the optimization process. HITO was successfully applied using NSGA-II for solving the integration and test order problem. HITO can use two hyper-heuristic selection methods: Choice Function and Multi-armed Bandit. However, a hypotheses behind this study is that HITO does not depend of NSGA-II and can be used with other MOEAs. To this aim, this paper presents results from evaluation experiments comparing the performance of HITO using two different MOEAs: NSGA-II and SPEA2.

Each trip starts and ends in one of the hotels. The goal is to maximize the total score computed by the sum of the score of the trips to the visit points of interest. We propose a hyperheuristic that is based on a hill-climbing procedure. The low-level heuristics have been selected focused on the different constraints of the problem. We have put special attention on the collaboration among the low-level heuristics, in order to guide the algorithm to the most promising areas, considering both the time constraints and the improvement of the score.

In these cases they tend to use general-purpose solvers that have no guarantee to perform well on their specific problem. The relatively new field of hyper-heuristics provides an alternative to the potential pit-falls of general-purpose solvers, by allowing practitioners to generate a custom algorithm optimized for their problem of interest. Hyper-heuristics are meta-heuristics operating on algorithm space employing targeted primitives to compose algorithms. This paper explores the advantages and disadvantages of expanding a hyper-heuristic's primitive-space with additional primitives. This should allow for an increase in quality of evolved algorithms. However, increasing the search space of a meta-heuristic almost always results in longer time to convergence and lower quality results for the same amount of computational time, but also all too often lower quality results at convergence, potentially making a problem impractical to solve for a practitioner. This paper explores the scalability of hyper-heuristics as the primitive-space is increased, demonstrating significantly increased quality solutions at convergence with a corresponding increase in convergence time. Additionally, this paper explores the impact that the nature of the added primitives have on the performance of the hyper-heuristic.</p></span></span></span></li>

However not all selection vectors and solution acceptance criteria pairings deliver competitive results when faced with differing problem instance features and computational time limits. We evaluate pairings of six different operator selection vectors and eight solution acceptance criteria, and monitor the performance of the adaptive hyper-heuristic when applying each pairing to a set of Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem instances of the same size but with different features. The results show that a few pairings of operator selection vector and acceptance criterion perform consistently well, while others require a longer computational time to deliver competitive results.

This paper proposes the use of a single hyperheuristic algorithm that learns search strategies across a broad range of problem instances, providing a single generalist approach. We have developed a Hyperheuristic algorithm for CIT, and report experiments that show that our algorithm competes with known best solutions across constrained and unconstrained problems: For all 26 real-world subjects, it equals or outperforms the best result previously reported in the literature. We also present evidence that our algorithm's strong generic performance results from its unsupervised learning.

By combining algorithm portfolios and online selection, our hope is to design a problem-independent hybrid strategy with diverse problem solving capability.

Marshall, MSc Thesis, School of Mathematics, Statistics and Operations Research, Victoria University of Wellington, 2015 [<a href="http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/handle/10063/4242?show=full"  target="_blank">PDF</a>] <span class="tooltip-wrap">[<font color="red">ABSTRACT</font>]<span class="tooltip-content"><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #CCCCCC">The development of a heuristic to solve an optimisation problem in a new domain, or a specific variation of an existing problem domain, is often beyond the means of many smaller businesses. This is largely due to the task normally needing to be assigned to a human expert, and such experts tend to be scarce and expensive. One of the aims of hyper-heuristic research is to automate all or part of the heuristic development process and thereby bring the generation of new heuristics within the means of more organisations. A second aim of hyper-heuristic research is to ensure that the process by which a domain specific heuristic is developed is itself independent of the problem domain. This enables a hyper-heuristic to exist and operate above the combinatorial optimisation problem "domain barrier" and generalise across different problem domains.

A common issue with heuristic development is that a heuristic is often designed or evolved using small size problem instances and then assumed to perform well on larger problem instances. The goal of this thesis is to extend current hyper-heuristic research towards answering the question: How can a hyper-heuristic efficiently and effectively adapt the selection, generation and manipulation of domain specific heuristics as you move from small size and/or narrow domain problems to larger size and/or wider domain problems? In other words, how can different hyperheuristics respond to scalability issues?

Each hyper-heuristic has its own strengths and weaknesses. In the context of hyper-heuristic research, this thesis contributes towards understanding scalability issues by firstly developing a compact and effective heuristic that can be applied to other problem instances of differing sizes in a compatible problem domain. We construct a hyper-heuristic for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem domain to establish whether a heuristic for a specific problem domain can be developed which is compact and easy to interpret. The results show that generation of a simple but effective heuristic is possible.

Secondly we develop two different types of hyper-heuristic and compare their performance across different combinatorial optimisation problem domains. We construct and compare simplified versions of two existing hyper-heuristics (adaptive and grammar-based), and analyse how each handles the trade-off between computation speed and quality of the solution. The performance of the two hyper-heuristics are tested on seven different problem domains compatible with the HyFlex (Hyper-heuristic Flexible) framework. The results indicate that the adaptive hyper-heuristic is able to deliver solutions of a pre-defined quality in a shorter computational time than the grammar-based hyper-heuristic.

Thirdly we investigate how the adaptive hyper-heuristic developed in the second stage of this thesis can respond to problem instances of the same size, but containing different features and complexity. We investigate how, with minimal knowledge about the problem domain and features of the instance being worked on, a hyper-heuristic can modify its processes to respond to problem instances containing different features and problem domains of different complexity. In this stage we allow the adaptive hyper-heuristic to select alternative vectors for the selection of problem domain operators, and acceptance criteria used to determine whether solutions should be retained or discarded. We identify a consistent difference between the best performing pairings of selection vector and acceptance criteria, and those pairings which perform poorly.

This thesis shows that hyper-heuristics can respond to scalability issues, although not all do so with equal ease. The flexibility of an adaptive hyper-heuristic enables it to perform faster than the more rigid grammar-based hyper-heuristic, but at the expense of losing a reusable heuristic.</p></span></span></span></li>

They have been successfully used to solve complex problems in the domains of learning, design and optimization.

When using an EA practitioners have to define its main components such as the variation operators, the selection and replacement mechanisms. The performance of an EA can be greatly enhanced if the components are tailored to the specific situation being addressed. These modifications are usually done manually and require a reasonable degree of expertise. In order to ease the use of EAs some researchers have developed methods to automatically design this type of algorithms. Usually, these methods rely on an (meta-) algorithm that combine components and parameters, in order to learn the one that is most suited for the problem being addressed. The area of Hyper-Heuristics (HH) emerges in this context focusing on the development of efficient meta-algorithms.

Genetic Programming (GP), specifically the grammar based variants, are commonly used as HH. In this work, we study and analyze the conditions in which Grammatical Evolution (GE) can be enhanced to automatically design EAs.

The main contributions can be divided in three aspects. Firstly, we propose an HH framework that relies on GE as the search algorithm. The proposed framework is divided in two complementary phases: Learning and Validation. In Learning the GE engine is used to combine low level components that are specified in a Context Free Grammar. In the second phase, Validation, the best algorithms learned are selected to be applied to scenarios different from the learning, in order to evaluate their generalization capacity.

Secondly we study the impact that the learning conditions have in the final structure of the algorithms that are being learned. Moreover, we analyze the relationship between the quality exhibited by the algorithms during learning and their effective optimization ability when used in unseen scenarios. In concrete we analyze if the best strategies discover in learning still have the same good behavior in validation.

Our final contribution addresses some of the limitations exhibited by Grammatical Evolution. The result is a novel representation with an enhanced performance.</p></span></span></span></li>

A few industrial engineering examples include inventory optimization, production scheduling, and vehicle routing, all areas which have a significant impact on the economic success of society. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to predict which meta-heuristic from the multitude of algorithms available, will be best to address a specific problem. Furthermore, many algorithm development options exist with regards to operator selection and parameter setting. Within this context, the idea of working towards a higher level of automation in algorithm design was born. Hyper-heuristics promote the design of more generally applicable search methodologies and tend to focus on performing relatively well on a large set of different types of problems.

This thesis develops a heterogeneous meta-hyper-heuristic algorithm (HMHH) for single-objective unconstrained continuous optimization problems. The algorithm development process focused on investigating the use of meta-heuristics as low level heuristics in a hyper-heuristic context. This strategy is in stark contrast to the problem-specific low level heuristics traditionally employed in a hyper-heuristic framework. Alternative low level meta-heuristics, entity-to-algorithm allocation strategies, and strategies for incorporating local search into the HMHH algorithm were evaluated to obtain an algorithm which performs well against both its constituent low level meta-heuristics and four state- of-the-art multi-method algorithms.

Finally, the impact of diversity management on the HMHH algorithm was investigated. Hyper-heuristics lend themselves to two types of diversity management, namely solution space diversity (SSD) management and heuristic space diversity (HSD) management. The concept of heuristic space diversity was introduced and a quantitative metric was defined to measure heuristic space diversity. An empirical evaluation of various solution space diversity and heuristic space diversity intervention mechanisms showed that the systematic control of heuristic space diversity has a significant impact on hyper-heuristic performance.</p></span></span></span></li>

The objective of ALS is to minimise the deviations of the landing time of each aircraft from its target landing time. In this paper, we propose a dynamic hyper-heuristic algorithm for the ALS problem. In our approach, the Scatter Search algorithm is chosen as the high level heuristic to build a chain of intensification and diversification priority rules, which are applied to generate the landing sequence by different priority rules, which are low level heuristics in the hyper-heuristic framework. The landing time for each aircraft can be calculated efficiently based on the landing sequence. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can obtain high quality solutions for ALS.</p></span></span></span></li>

However, there is plenty of room to improve the performance of these algorithms, especially by using heuristic scheduling. As such, this paper presents a novel heuristic scheduling algorithm, called hyper-heuristic scheduling algorithm (HHSA), to find better scheduling solutions for cloud computing systems. The diversity detection and improvement detection operators are employed by the proposed algorithm to dynamically determine which low-level heuristic is to be used in finding better candidate solutions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, this study compares the proposed method with several state-of-the-art scheduling algorithms, by having all of them implemented on CloudSim (a simulator) and Hadoop (a real system). The results show that HHSA can significantly reduce the makespan of task scheduling compared with the other scheduling algorithms evaluated in this paper, on both CloudSim and Hadoop.</p></span></span></span></li>

- Hyper-heuristics are a class of high-level search techniques which operate on a search space of heuristics rather than directly on a search space of solutions. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the suitability of using genetic programming as a hyper-heuristic methodology to generate constructive heuristics to solve the multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problem
Design/methodology/approach
- Early hyper-heuristics focused on selecting and applying a low-level heuristic at each stage of a search. Recent trends in hyper-heuristic research have led to a number of approaches being developed to automatically generate new heuristics from a set of heuristic components. A population of heuristics to rank knapsack items are trained on a subset of test problems and then applied to unseen instances.
Findings
- The results over a set of standard benchmarks show that genetic programming can be used to generate constructive heuristics which yield human-competitive results.
Originality/value
- In this work the authors show that genetic programming is suitable as a method to generate reusable constructive heuristics for the multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problem. This is classified as a hyper-heuristic approach as it operates on a search space of heuristics rather than a search space of solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first time in the literature a GP hyper-heuristic has been used to solve the multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problem. The results suggest that using GP to evolve ranking mechanisms merits further future research effort.</p></span></span></span></li>

A theoretical model of the execution time of the unified scheme is empirically adapted for particular metaheuristics and hyperheuristics through experimentation. The model is used to decide at running time the number of threads to obtain a reduced execution time. The number of threads is different for the different basic functions in the scheme, and depends on the problem to be solved, the metaheuristic scheme, the implementation of the basic functions and the computational system where the problem is solved. The applicability of the proposal is shown with a problem of minimization of electricity consumption in exploitation of wells. Experimental results show that satisfactory execution times can be achieved with auto-tuning techniques based on theoretical-empirical models of the execution time.</p></span></span></span></li>

We propose a unified encoding of a solution and a set of low level heuristics which are domain-independent and which change the solution itself. This approach enables us to address NP-hard problems and generate good approximate solutions in a reasonable time without a large amount of additional work required to tailor search methodologies for the problem in hand. In particular, we focused on solving DNA sequencing by hybrydization with errors, which is known to be strongly NP-hard. The approach was extensively tested by solving multiple instances of well-known combinatorial problems and compared with results generated by meta heuristics that have been tailored for specific problem domains.</p></span></span></span></li>

The values of the kinetic parameters of the chemical reaction can be determined by integrating the equation of the reaction rate. This is a classical opti- mization problem that can be approached with metaheuristic methods. The use of a parallel, parameterized scheme for metaheuristics facilitates the development of metaheuristics and their application. The unified scheme can also be used to implement hyperheuristics on top of pa- rameterized metaheuristics, so selecting appropriate values for the metaheuristic parameters, and consequently the metaheuristic itself. The hyperheuristic approach provides satisfactory values for the metaheuristic parameters and, consequently, satisfactory metaheuristics for the problem of determining the kinetic constants.</p></span></span></span></li>

Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation is used to define the problem. By the proposed GP method, a subset of the items is repeatedly selected and placed into the available current best location of the shelves in the warehouse, until all the items have been assigned with locations. A heuristic matching function is evolved by GP to guide the selection of the subsets of items. Our comparison between the proposed GP approach and the traditional ILP approach shows that GP can obtain near-optimal solutions on the training data within a short period of time. Moreover, the evolved heuristics can achieve good optimization results on unseen scenarios, comparable to that on the scenario used for training. This shows that the evolved heuristics have good reusability and can be directly applied for slightly different scenarios without any new search process.</p></span></span></span></li>

A hyper-heuristic is a search method or a learning mechanism that controls a set of low level heuristics or combines different heuristic components to generate heuristics for solving a given computationally hard problem. In this study, we investigate into a novel apprenticeship-learning-based approach which is used to automatically generate a hyper-heuristic for vehicle routing. This approach itself can be considered as a hyper-heuristic which operates in a train and test fashion. A state-of-the-art hyper-heuristic is chosen as an expert which is the winner of a previous hyper-heuristic competition. Trained on small vehicle routing instances, the learning approach yields various classifiers, each capturing different actions that the expert hyper-heuristic performs during the search process. Those classifiers are then used to produce a hyper-heuristic which is potentially capable of generalizing the actions of the expert hyper-heuristic while solving the unseen instances. The experimental results on vehicle routing using the Hyper-heuristic Flexible (HyFlex) framework shows that the apprenticeship-learning-based hyper-heuristic delivers an outstanding performance when compared to the expert and some other previously proposed hyper-heuristics.</p></span></span></span></li>

The goal is to maximise the average bin fullness after placement of a long stream of items. A recent work describes an approach for solving this problem based on a 'policy matrix' representation in which each decision option is independently given a value and the highest value option is selected. A policy matrix can also be viewed as a heuristic with many parameters and then the search for a good policy matrix can be treated as a parameter tuning process. In this study, we show that the Irace parameter tuning algorithm produces heuristics which outperform the standard human designed heuristics for various instances of the online bin packing problem.</p></span></span></span></li>

This area of bio-inspired intelligent systems covers a wide range of algorithms selection techniques. This type of self-organising mechanism uses heuristics to optimise heuristics. Many discussions focus on the quality of solutions of the problems obtained from the hyper-heuristics, very little discussion concentrates on the generated algorithms themselves. Some hyper-heuristic frameworks tend to be highly constrained, their limited instruction sets prevent the state-of-the-art algorithms from being expressed. In addition, often the generated algorithms are not human-readable. In this paper, we propose a possible extension of some existing hyper-heuristic formulations, so that some of the current open issues can be addressed and it becomes possible to produce self-organizing heuristics that adapt themselves automatically to the environment when the class of problems changes. This together with the analysis of the evolved algorithms, may lead to human-competitive results.</p></span></span></span></li>

Selection hyper-heuristics have been successfully employed in many problem domains. Nevertheless, a theoretical foundation of these heuristics is largely missing. Gaining insight into the behaviour of selection hyper-heuristics is challenging due to the complexity and random design of these heuristics. This paper is one of the initial studies to analyse rigorously the runtime of selection hyper-heuristics with a number of the most commonly used learning mechanisms; namely, simple random, random gradient, greedy, and permutation. We derive the runtime of selection hyper-heuristic with these learning mechanisms not only on a classical example problem, but also on a general model of fitness landscapes. This in turn helps in understanding the behaviour of hyper-heuristics. Our results show that all the considered selections hyper-heuristics have roughly the same performance. This suggests that the learning mechanisms do not necessarily improve the performance of hyper-heuristics. A new learning mechanism that improves the performance of hyper-heuristic on our example problem is presented.</p></span></span></span></li>

However, there has been no comprehensive empirical study of different search algorithms across multiple different real world datasets. In this paper we present an empirical study of global, local and hybrid meta- and hyper-heuristic search based algorithms on 10 real world datasets. We find that the hyper-heuristics are particularly effective. For example, the hyper-heuristic genetic algorithm significantly outperformed the other six approaches (and with high effect size) for solution quality 85% of the time, and was also faster than all others 70% of the time. Furthermore, correlation analysis reveals that it scales well as the number of requirements increases.</p></span></span></span></li>

While most hyper-heuristic research employs the term generality in describing the potential for solving various problems, the performance changes across different domains are rarely reported. Furthermore, a hyper-heuristic's performance study purely on the topic of heuristic sets is uncommon. Similarly, experimental limits are generally ignored when comparing hyper-heuristics. In order to demonstrate the effect of these generality related elements, nine heuristic sets with different improvement capabilities and sizes were generated for each of three target problem domains. These three problem domains are home care scheduling, nurse rostering and patient admission scheduling. Fourteen hyper-heuristics with varying intensification/diversification characteristics were analysed under various settings. Empirical results indicate that the performance of selection hyper-heuristics changes significantly under different experimental conditions.</p></span></span></span></li>

In this work, we propose a hyper-heuristic framework to automatically generate an effective and generic solution method by utilizing grammatical evolution. In the proposed framework, grammatical evolution is used as an online solver builder, which takes several heuristic components (e.g., different acceptance criteria and different neighborhood structures) as inputs and evolves templates of perturbation heuristics. The evolved templates are improvement heuristics, which represent a complete search method to solve the problem at hand. To test the generality and the performance of the proposed method, we consider two well-known combinatorial optimization problems: exam timetabling (Carter and ITC 2007 instances) and the capacitated vehicle routing problem (Christofides and Golden instances). We demonstrate that the proposed method is competitive, if not superior, when compared to state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics, as well as bespoke methods for these different problem domains. In order to further improve the performance of the proposed framework we utilize an adaptive memory mechanism, which contains a collection of both high quality and diverse solutions and is updated during the problem solving process. Experimental results show that the grammatical evolution hyper-heuristic, with an adaptive memory, performs better than the grammatical evolution hyper-heuristic without a memory. The improved framework also outperforms some bespoke methodologies, which have reported best known results for some instances in both problem domains.</p></span></span></span></li>

Recent research has focused on developing more appropriate environments for the design and implementation of heuristics. Particularly, the software design consideration is restricted only to the application of design patterns; a detailed discussion regarding methodological background and architectural design approaches is not adequately considered. In this work, we want to discuss software design issues, from an object-oriented perspective, which can be useful to develop heuristics methods considering different abstraction levels, ranging from specialized components to more general-purpose architectures. A theoretical algorithmic model is presented, which forms the basis for a design pattern proposal named Flowchart pattern. We provide a case study of a new heuristic construction framework that uses the pattern at its core, and we discuss how such tool has been used in the implementation of a comprehensive hyperheuristic architecture. The framework usage and the modular structure provided by the hyperheuristic architecture demonstrates how the pattern allows to construct objectual representations of algorithms, and the main consequence is the direct decoupling of an algorithm's structure, its logic behaviour and the data that it treats, which allows for the development of highly dynamic structures that can be modified even at runtime. This approach may open new alternatives in which applied optimisation and software design meet.</p></span></span></span></li>

Hyper-heuristics are high level search methodologies that operate on the space of heuristics to solve hard computational problems. A frequently used hyper-heuristic framework mixes a predefined set of low level heuristics during the search process. While most of the work on such selection hyper-heuristics in the literature are empirical, we analyse the runtime of the hyper-heuristics rigorously. Our initial analysis shows that mixing heuristics could lead to exponentially faster search than individual (deterministically chosen) heuristics on chosen problems. Both mixing of variation operators and mixing of acceptance criteria are investigated on some selected problems. It is shown that mixing operators is only efficient with the right mixing distribution (parameter setting). Additionally, some of the existing adaptation mechanisms for mixing operators are also evaluated.</p></span></span></span></li>

However, the fields that encompass BBSAs, including Evolutionary Computing, are mostly focused on improving algorithm performance over increasingly diversified problem classes. By definition, the payoff for designing a high quality general purpose solver is far larger in terms of the number of problems it can address, than a specialized BBSA. This paper introduces a novel approach to creating tailored BBSAs through automated design employing genetic programming. An experiment is reported which demonstrates its ability to create novel BBSAs which outperform established BBSAs including canonical evolutionary algorithms.</p></span></span></span></li>

Early hyper-heuristic research focussed on selecting and applying a low-level heuristic at a given stage of an optimisation process. Recent trends have led to a number of approaches being developed to automatically generate heuristics for a number of combinatorial optimisation problems. Previous work on the VRP has shown that the application of hyper-heuristic approaches can yield successful results. In this paper we investigate the potential of grammatical evolution as a method to evolve the components of a variable neighbourhood search (VNS) framework. In particular, two components are generated; constructive heuristics to create initial solutions and neighbourhood move operators to change the state of a given solution. The proposed method is tested on standard benchmark instances of two common VRP variants.</p></span></span></span></li>

Although using a general purpose programming language together with a special library for the domain is common practice, it still requires a considerable amount of programming knowledge, making it hard for domain experts who might have limited or no programming skills. In the CHeSC (Cross-domain Heuristic Search Challenge) competition, researchers and practitioners from different research fields use the HyFlex platform to develop hyper-heuristics. The domain specific language proposed in this study aims to help these researchers to focus on hyper-heuristic development rather than the details of Java programming.</p></span></span></span></li>

Multi-objective Software Module Clustering Problem is an important and challenging problem in Software Engineering whose main goal is to obtain a good modular structure of the Software System. Software Engineers greatly emphasize on good modular structure as it is easier to comprehend, develop and maintain such software systems. In recent times, the problem has been converted into a Search-based Software Engineering Problem with multiple objectives. This problem is NP hard as it is an instance of Graph Partitioning and hence cannot be solved using traditional optimization techniques. The MHypGA is a fast and effective metaheuristic search technique for suggesting software module clusters in a software system while maximizing cohesion and minimizing the coupling of the software modules. It incorporates twelve low-level heuristics which are based on different methods of selection, crossover and mutation operations of Genetic Algorithms. The selection mechanism to select a low-level heuristic is based on reinforcement learning with adaptive weights. The efficacy of the algorithm has been studied on six real-world module clustering problems reported in the literature and the comparison of the results prove the superiority of the MHypGA in terms of quality of solutions and computational time.</p></span></span></span></li>

This paper proposes a new approach to this problem: to build an algorithm tailored to the application problem at hand. More specifically, we propose an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to automatically evolve Bayesian Network Classifiers (BNCs). The method receives as input a list of the main components of BNC algorithms, and uses an EA to encode these components. Given an input dataset, the method tests different combinations of components to that specific application domain. The method was tested in 10 UCI datasets, and compared to three classical BNCs and a greedy search algorithm. Results show that the current algorithms can indeed be improved, but that the EA is currently outperformed by the greedy search.</p></span></span></span></li>

We report experiments that show that our algorithm competes with known best solutions across constrained and unconstrained problems. For all 26 real world subjects and 29 of the 30 constrained benchmark problems studied, it equals or improves upon the best known result. We also present evidence that our algorithm's strong generic performance is caused by its effective unsupervised learning.

The hyper-heuristic manages a generic sequence of constructive and perturbative low-level heuristics, which are gradually applied to construct or improve partial routes. We present some design considerations to allow the collaboration among heuristics, and to find the most promising sequence. The search process is carried out by applying a set of operators which constructs new sequences of heuristics, i.e., solving strategies. We have used a general and low-computational cost parameter control strategy, based on simple reinforcement learning ideas, to assign non-arbitrary reward/penalty values and guide the selection of operators. Our approach has been tested using some standard state-of-the-art benchmarks, which present different topologies and dynamic properties, and we have compared it with previous hyper-heuristics and several well-known methods proposed in the literature. The experimental results have shown that our approach is able to attain quite stable and good quality solutions after solving various problems, and to adapt to dynamic scenarios more naturally than other methods. Particularly, in the dynamic case we have obtained high-quality solutions when compared with other algorithms in the literature. Thus, we conclude that our self-adaptive hyper-heuristic is an interesting approach for solving vehicle routing problems as it has been able (1) to guide the search for appropriate operators, and (2) to adapt itself to particular states of the problem by choosing a suitable combination of heuristics.</p></span></span></span></li>

Our evolved solvers outperform the best FreeCell solver to date by three distinct measures: 1) number of search nodes is reduced by over 78%; 2) time to solution is reduced by over 94\%; and 3) average solution length is reduced by over 30\%. Our top solver is the best published FreeCell player to date, solving 99.65\% of the standard Microsoft 32 K problem set.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the suitability of using genetic programming as a hyper-heuristic methodology to generate constructive heuristics to solve the multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problem. Design/methodology/approach: Early hyper-heuristics focused on selecting and applying a low-level heuristic at each stage of a search. Recent trends in hyper-heuristic research have led to a number of approaches being developed to automatically generate new heuristics from a set of heuristic components. A population of heuristics to rank knapsack items are trained on a subset of test problems and then applied to unseen instances. Findings: The results over a set of standard benchmarks show that genetic programming can be used to generate constructive heuristics which yield human-competitive results. Originality/value: In this work the authors show that genetic programming is suitable as a method to generate reusable constructive heuristics for the multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problem. This is classified as a hyper-heuristic approach as it operates on a search space of heuristics rather than a search space of solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first time in the literature a GP hyper-heuristic has been used to solve the multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problem. The results suggest that using GP to evolve ranking mechanisms merits further future research effort.</p></span></span></span></li>

Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, the traditional exact approaches might fail to find a solution even for a given instance. Hyper-heuristics which search the space of heuristics for high quality solutions are alternative methods that have been increasingly used in solving such problems. In this study, a curriculum based course timetabling problem at Yeditepe University is described. An improvement oriented heuristic selection strategy combined with a simulated annealing move acceptance as a hyper-heuristic utilizing a set of low level constraint oriented neighbourhood heuristics is investigated for solving this problem. The proposed hyper-heuristic was initially developed to handle a variety of problems in a particular domain with different properties considering the nature of the low level heuristics. On the other hand, a goal of hyper-heuristic development is to build methods which are general. Hence, the proposed hyper-heuristic is applied to six other problem domains and its performance is compared to different state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics to test its level of generality. The empirical results show that the proposed method is sufficiently general and powerful.</p></span></span></span></li>

The most successful strategy for inducing decision trees, the greedy top-down approach, has been continuously improved by researchers over the years. This work, following recent breakthroughs in the automatic design of machine learning algorithms, proposes a hyper-heuristic evolutionary algorithm for automatically generating decision-tree induction algorithms, named HEAD-DT. We perform extensive experiments in 20 public data sets to assess the performance of HEAD-DT, and we compare it to traditional decision-tree algorithms such as C4.5 and CART. Results show that HEAD-DT can generate algorithms that significantly outperform C4.5 and CART regarding predictive accuracy and F-Measure.</p></span></span></span></li>

These technologies are very useful for users who do not need the exact solution but who care very much about the response time. For every existing heuristic algorithm has its pros and cons, a hyper-heuristic clustering algorithm based on the diversity detection and improvement detection operators to determine when to switch from one heuristic algorithm to another is presented to improve the clustering result in this paper. Several well-known datasets are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can provide a better clustering result than the state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms compared in this paper, namely, k-means, simulated annealing, tabu search, and genetic k-means algorithm.</p></span></span></span></li>

A iterative selection hyper-heuristic framework based on single-point search relies on two key components, a heuristic selection method and a move acceptance criteria. The Choice Function is an elegant heuristic selection method which scores heuristics based on a combination of three different measures and applies the heuristic with the highest rank at each given step. Each measure is weighted appropriately to provide balance between intensification and diversification during the heuristic search process. Choosing the right parameter values to weight these measures is not a trivial process and a small number of methods have been proposed in the literature. In this study we describe a new method, inspired by reinforcement learning, which controls these parameters automatically. The proposed method is tested and compared to previous approaches over a standard benchmark across six problem domains.</p></span></span></span></li>

This problem often exhibits a noisy environment due to the properties of the race track as well as the components of the car. Selection hyper-heuristics are methodologies that control and mix different predefined set of heuristics during the search process for solving computationally hard problems. In this study, we represent the car setup problem as a real valued optimisation problem and investigate the performance of different approaches including a set of heuristics and their combination controlled by a selection hyper-heuristic framework. The results show that selection hyper-heuristics and a tuned heuristic perform well and are promising approaches even in a dynamically changing, noisy environment.</p></span></span></span></li>

They can be used for solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) in different ways considering the variety of hyper-heuristics and low-level heuristics. A particular approach which has been receiving attention in the recent years is based on variable ordering using hyper-heuristics. A hyper-heuristic decides the next variable to process using a set of predefined heuristics considering the features that describe the instance at a given point during the search in this framework. This study explores an approach in which each hyper-heuristic is represented as a set of vectors mapping instance features to heuristics for variable ordering. The results suggest that the proposed approach is able to combine the strengths of different heuristics and compensate for their weaknesses performing better than each heuristic in isolation across a range of instances.</p></span></span></span></li>

The LCS based hyperheuristic is built from multi-objective low-level heuristics that are derived from an existing MFMP solver. While the low-level heuristics use multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to search non-dominated solutions, the LCS based hyperheuristic applies the non-dominance concept at the primitive heuristic level. Two LCS, namely the eXtended Classifier System (XCS) and the sUpervised Classifier System (UCS) are augmented by multi-objective reward and accuracy functions, respectively. The results show that UCS performs better than XCS: the hyperheuristic learned by the UCS is able to select low-level heuristics which create MFMP solutions that, in terms of a distance-based convergence metric, are closer to the derived global Pareto curves on a large set of MFMP test scenarios than the solutions created by heuristics that are selected by the XCS hyperheuristic.</p></span></span></span></li>

The performance of selection hyper-heuristics is strongly dependant on low-level heuristic sets employed for solving target problems. Therefore, the generality of hyper-heuristics should be examined across various heuristic sets. Unlike the majority of hyper-heuristics research, where the low-level heuristic set is considered given, the present study investigates the influence of the low-level heuristics on the hyper-heuristic's performance. To achieve this, a number of heuristic sets was generated for the patient admission scheduling problem by setting the parameters of a set of parametric heuristics with specific values. These values were set such that nine heuristic sets with different improvement capabilities, speed characteristics and size were generated. A group of hyper-heuristics with certain selection mechanisms and acceptance criteria having dissimilar intensification/diversification abilities were taken from the literature enabling a comprehensive analysis. The experimental results indicated that different hyper-heuristics perform superiorly on distinct heuristic sets. The results can be explained and hence result in hyper-heuristic design recommendations.</p></span></span></span></li>

The resulting algorithm is expected to be effective for solving a given set of target problem instances. However, since the algorithm is dedicated, it is hard to adapt and to apply to other problems. Meta-heuristics were brought in to cope with this drawback. Nevertheless, in most of the meta-heuristic studies, the employed meta-heuristics have been implemented as rather problem-dependent methodologies. Hyper-heuristics furnish problem-independent management opportunities differently from such search and optimisation algorithms. The present dissertation focuses on the generality of hyper-heuristics. It thereby aims at designing intelligent hyper-heuristics so that generality is facilitated. While most works on hyper-heuristics make use of the term generality in describing the potential for solving various problems, the performance changes across different domains have only rarely been reported. Additionally, there are other generality related elements such as the performance variations over distinct heuristic sets, that are usually ignored. This means that there is no study fully discussing generality questions while providing a hyper-heuristic design capable of addressing them.To this end, the factors affecting the hyper-heuristics' generality are determined and several novel hyper-heuristic components are developed based on these factors. Then, the hyper-heuristics using the new components are tested across various problem domains on different heuristic sets, while also varying the experimental limits. First, each developed hyper-heuristic is applied to only one problem domain. The performance of these hyper-heuristics is compared with other algorithms encountered in the literature. The information gathered during these experiments is used later on to design a highly adaptive, intelligent selection hyper-heuristic.The ultimate result of the present PhD research is called the Generic Intelligent Hyper-heuristic (GIHH). It is equipped with multiple online adaptive hyper-heuristic procedures and decision mechanisms for simultaneously coordinating them. GIHH is expected to evolve for different search environments without human intervention. A simplified version of GIHH is tested via a series of experiments on three problems from practice to measure its generality level. A comprehensive performance analysis is conducted using a group of selection hyper-heuristics only involving heuristic selection and move acceptance mechanisms from the literature. The analysis provides strong conclusions about when a hyper-heuristic with certain characteristics has advantages or disadvantages.Finally, GIHH is tested on other challenging combinatorial optimisation problems under different empirical conditions. The computational results indicate that GIHH is effective in solving the target instances from distinct problem domains. Additionally, GIHH won the first international cross domain heuristic search challenge 2011 against 19 high-level algorithms developed by the other academic competitors. The winning hyper-heuristic was then used to investigate the performance and contribution of low-level heuristics while simultaneously solving three problems with routing and rostering characteristics. This completely new application of a hyper-heuristic offers promising perspectives for supporting dedicated heuristic development.</p></span></span></span></li>

The study comprises over Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). All these optimization techniques are highly appraised for their skills to handle the complex problems. A number of classical operators and parameters have been examined with each hyper-heuristics due to high diversity in datasets. Secondly, Domain specified Low Level Heuristics have been designed under several operational classifications. In addition, obtaining effective deployment and utilization of the academic resources to the greatest extent are counted as supplementary but essential advantages of the research work.</p></span></span></span></li>

<li style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;"><b>A genetic programming hyper-heuristic approach for evolving 2-D strip packing heuristics</b>, by Burke, Edmund K and Hyde, Matthew and Kendall, Graham and Woodward, John, <i>IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation</i>, 14(6), IEEE, 2010 [<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5491153/"  target="_blank">PDF</a>] <span class="tooltip-wrap">[<font color="red">ABSTRACT</font>]<span class="tooltip-content"><p style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #CCCCCC">We present a genetic programming (GP) system to evolve reusable heuristics for the 2-D strip packing problem. The evolved heuristics are constructive, and decide both which piece to pack next and where to place that piece, given the current partial solution. This paper contributes to a growing research area that represents a paradigm shift in search methodologies. Instead of using evolutionary computation to search a space of solutions, we employ it to search a space of heuristics for the problem. A key motivation is to investigate methods to automate the heuristic design process. It has been stated in the literature that humans are very good at identifying good building blocks for solution methods. However, the task of intelligently searching through all of the potential combinations of these components is better suited to a computer. With such tools at their disposal, heuristic designers are then free to commit more of their time to the creative process of determining good components, while the computer takes on some of the design process by intelligently combining these components. This paper shows that a GP hyper-heuristic can be employed to automatically generate human competitive heuristics in a very-well studied problem domain.</p></span></span></span></li>

A new unbiased algorithmic comparison strategy is suggested using hypervolume convergence. A recent hyperheuristic named AMALGAM, which dynamically combines the strengths of multiple metaheuristics, is applied to this problem for the first time, demonstrating superior performance. The shortcomings of a novel multiobjective greedy algorithm are also demonstrated.</p></span></span></span></li>

The hyperheuristic manages a sequence of constructive-perturbative pairs of low-level heuristics which are applied sequentially in order to construct and improve partial solutions. We present some design considerations that we have taken into account to find the most promising sequence and allow the collaboration among low-level heuristics. Our approach has been tested using some standard state-of-the-art benchmarks and we have compared them with several well-known methods proposed in the literature. We have obtained, on average, stable and good quality solutions after solving various types of problems. Thus, we conclude that our collaborative framework is an interesting approach as it has proved to be: (1) able to adapt itself to different problem instances by choosing a suitable combination of low-level heuristics and (2) capable of preserving stability when solving different types of problems.</p></span></span></span></li>

This has consequences for the use of genetic programming as a method to discover new search algorithms and, more generally, problem solvers. Furthermore, it has also rather important philosophical consequences in relation to the efforts of computer scientists to discover useful novel search algorithms.</p></span></span></span></li>

First of all a hyper-heuristic approach to the SBH problem was to be applied. In order to solve the SBH problem with the use of a general hyper-heuristic framework a number of software tools have been created. Design and development of the framework is based on the current research in the field of optimisation techniques. The second goal of this thesis was to check the behaviour and performance of the hyper-heuristic methods. Hyper-heuristics allow to change the set of moves that solver is capable of performing quickly and with a great flexibility. Sensitivity of modifications of this kind is examined in this work. In an ideal case hyper-heuristic method should work almost equally good with every reasonable set of allowed moves. The goal of hyper-heuristic algorithms is to learn and predict which moves are going to improve the solution and which are not. Thus, the aim of this work is to establish a verifiable use case for hyper-heuristic algorithms based on the solution to the SBH problem.</p></span></span></span></li>

REVAC, which has recently been proposed for tuning, has been used to find the best operators parameter values. The results obtained are very encouraging and have improved the results from both the single heuristics and the single hyperheuristics' tests.

The main motivation behind the development of such approaches is the goal of developing automated scheduling methods which are not restricted to one problem. In this paper we report the investigation of a hyperheuristic approach and evaluate it on various instances of two distinct timetabling and rostering problems. In the framework of our hyperheuristic approach, heuristics compete using rules based on the principles of reinforcement learning. A tabu list of heuristics is also maintained which prevents certain heuristics from being chosen at certain times during the search. We demonstrate that this tabu-search hyperheuristic is an easily re-usable method which can produce solutions of at least acceptable quality across a variety of problems and instances. In effect the proposed method is capable of producing solutions that are competitive with those obtained using state-of-the-art problem-specific techniques for the problems studied here, but is fundamentally more general than those techniques.</p></span></span></span></li>

The hyperheuristic manages the choice of which lowerlevel heuristic method should be applied at any given time, depending upon the characteristics of the region of the solution space currently under exploration. We analyse the behaviour of several different hyperheuristic approaches for a real-world personnel scheduling problem. Results obtained show the effectiveness of our approach for this problem and suggest wider applicability of hyperheuristic approaches to other problems of scheduling and combinatorial optimisation.</p></span></span></span></li>

There are two aims. The first is to circumvent the problems posed by a direct chromosome representation for the ETTP that consists of an array of events in which each value represents the timeslot which the corresponding event is assigned to. The second is to show that the adaptation of particular features in both the instance of the problem to be solved and the strategies used to solve it provides encouraging results for real ETTPs. There is much scope for investigating such approaches further, not only for the ETTP, but also for other related scheduling problems.</p></span></span></span></li>
