On the other side, Multi Objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) is a swarm intelligence algorithm functioning by means of inertia weight, learning factors and the mutation probability. In high-performance hyper-heuristic algorithm is used to find better scheduling solutions in cloud computing. To improve the scheduling results in terms of makespan, throughput, cost. Hyper-heuristic algorithm finds better scheduling solutions for cloud computing systems and to further improve the scheduling results in terms of make span. A novel Multi objective particle swarm optimization and Genetic Algorithm based hyper-heuristic resource scheduling algorithm has been designed as the hybrid algorithm. Performance of the proposed algorithm has also been evaluated through the Cloud Sim toolkit. We have compared our hybrid scheduling algorithm with existing common heuristic-based scheduling algorithms. The results thus obtained have shown a better performance by our algorithm than the existing algorithms, in terms of giving reduce cost and improve makespan. The proposed model shows the improved resource utilization, makespan, throughput.</p></span></span></span></li>

Although useful, meta-heuristic algorithms that make up these strategies often require specific domain knowledge in order to allow effective tuning before good quality solutions can be obtained. Hyper-heuristics provide an alternative methodology to meta-heuristics which permit adaptive selection and/or generation of meta-heuristics automatically during the search process. This paper describes our experience with four hyper-heuristic selection and acceptance mechanisms namely Exponential Monte Carlo with counter (EMCQ), Choice Function (CF), Improvement Selection Rules (ISR), and newly developed Fuzzy Inference Selection (FIS), using the t-way test generation problem as a case study. Based on the experimental results, we offer insights on why each strategy differs in terms of its performance.</p></span></span></span></li>

DSO is an artifact-inspired technique, as opposed to many nature-inspired algorithms used today. DSO is very flexible because it is not related to natural behaviors or phenomena. DSO has two core parts: the semiautonomous drones that fly over a landscape to explore, and the command center that processes the retrieved data and updates the drones' firmware whenever necessary. The self-adaptive aspect of DSO in this work is the perturbation/movement scheme, which is the procedure used to generate target coordinates. This procedure is evolved by the command center during the global optimization process in order to adapt DSO to the search landscape. We evaluated DSO on a set of widely employed single-objective benchmark functions. The statistical analysis of the results shows that the proposed method is competitive with the other methods, but we plan several future improvements to make it more powerful and robust.</p></span></span></span></li>

We consider gully pot maintenance as a risk-driven maintenance problem. We explore policies for preventative and corrective maintenance actions, and build optimised routes for maintenance vehicles. Our solutions take the risk impact of gully pot failure and its failure behaviour into account, in the presence of factors such as location, season and current status. The aim is to determine a maintenance policy that can automatically adjust its scheduling strategy in line with changes in the local environment, to minimise the surface flooding risk due to clogged gully pots. We introduce a rolling planning strategy, solved by a hyper-heuristic method. Results show the behaviour and strength of the automated adjustment in a range of real-world scenarios.</p></span></span></span></li>

However, due to the complexity of handling multiple objectives simultaneously, many approaches proposed in the literature often focus on the optimisation of a single objective when deciding the locations for a set of wind turbines spread across a given region. In this study, we tackle a multi-objective wind farm layout optimisation problem. Different from the previously proposed approaches, we are applying a high-level search method, known as selection hyper-heuristic to solve this problem. Selection hyper-heuristics mix and control a predefined set of low-level (meta)heuristics which operate on solutions. We test nine different selection hyper-heuristics including an online learning hyper-heuristic on a multi-objective wind farm layout optimisation problem. Our hyper-heuristic approaches manage three well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms as low-level metaheuristics. The empirical results indicate the success and potential of selection hyper-heuristics for solving this computationally difficult problem. We additionally explore other objectives in wind farm layout optimisation problems to gain a better understanding of the conflicting nature of those objectives.</p></span></span></span></li>

It usually contains many (four or more) potentially conflicting objectives such as makespan and mean weighted tardiness. On the other hand, evolving dispatching rules using genetic programming has demonstrated to be a promising approach to solving job shop scheduling due to its flexibility and scalability. In this paper, we aim to solve many-objective job shop scheduling with genetic programming and NSGA-III. However, NSGA-III is originally designed to work with uniformly distributed reference points which do not match well with the discrete and non-uniform Pareto front in job shop scheduling problems, resulting in many useless points during evolution. These useless points can significantly affect the performance of NSGA-III and genetic programming. To address this issue and inspired by particle swarm optimisation, a new reference point adaptation mechanism has been proposed in this paper. Experiment results on many-objective benchmark job shop scheduling instances clearly show that prominent improvement in performance can be achieved upon using our reference point adaptation mechanism in NSGA-III and genetic programming.</p></span></span></span></li>

Hyper-heuristic search has traditionally been divided into two layers: a lower problem-domain layer (where domain-specific heuristics are applied) and an upper hyper-heuristic layer, where heuristics are selected or generated. The interface between the two layers is commonly termed the "domain barrier". Historically this interface has been defined to be highly restrictive, in the belief that this is required for generality. We argue that this prevailing conception of domain barrier is so limiting as to defeat the original motivation for hyper-heuristics. We show how it is possible to make use of domain knowledge without loss of generality and describe generalized hyper-heuristics which can incorporate arbitrary domain knowledge.</p></span></span></span></li>

It considers a variety of stochastic factors to reeect the reality where the exact information such as the actual task demand and accessibilities of edges are unknown in advance. Existing works focus on obtaining a robust solution beforehand. However, it is also important to design eeective heuris-tics to adjust the solution in real time. In this paper, we develop a new Genetic Programming-based Hyper-Heuristic (GPHH) for automated heuristic design for UCARP. A novel eeective meta-algorithm is designed carefully to address the failures caused by the environment change. In addition, it employs domain knowledge to lter some infeasible candidate tasks for the heuristic function. e experimental results show that the proposed GPHH signiicantly outperforms the existing GPHH methods and manually designed heuristics. Moreover, we nd that eliminating the infeasible and distant tasks in advance can reduce much noise and improve the eecacy of the evolved heuristics. In addition, it is found that simply adding a slack factor to the expected task demand may not improve the performance of the GPHH.</p></span></span></span></li>

But in the real world uncertainty in such parameters is a major issue. In this work, we investigate a genetic programming based hyper-heuristic approach to evolving dispatching rules suitable for dynamic job shop scheduling under uncertainty. We consider uncertainty in processing times and consider multiple job types pertaining to different levels of uncertainty. In particular, we propose an approach to use exponential moving average of the deviations of the processing times in the dispatching rules. We test the performance of the proposed approach under different uncertain scenarios. Our results show that the proposed method performs significantly better for a wide range of uncertain scenarios.</p></span></span></span></li>

The two main categories of hyper-heuristics are selection and generation. Selection hyper-heuristics select existing low-level heuristics while generation hyper-heuristics create new heuristics. At the inception of the field single point searches were essentially employed by selection hyper-heuristics, however as the field progressed evolutionary algorithms are becoming more prominent. Evolutionary algorithms, namely, genetic programming, have chiefly been used for generation hyper-heuristics. Implementing evolutionary algorithm hyper-heuristics can be quite a time-consuming task which is daunting for first time researchers and practitioners who want to rather focus on the application domain the hyper-heuristic will be applied to which can be quite complex. This paper presents a Java toolkit for the implementation of evolutionary algorithm hyper-heuristics, namely, EvoHyp. EvoHyp includes libraries for a genetic algorithm selection hyper-heuristic (GenAlg), a genetic programming generation hyper-heuristic (GenProg), a distributed version of GenAlg (DistrGenAlg) and a distributed version of GenProg (DistrGenProg). The paper describes the libraries and illustrates how they can be used. The ultimate aim is to provide a toolkit which a non-expert in evolutionary algorithm hyper-heuristics can use. The paper concludes with an overview of future extensions of the toolkit.</p></span></span></span></li>

The most challenging part of the problem is to make real-time decisions (i.e. whether to accept the newly arrived service requests or not) during the execution of the routes. It is hardly applicable to use the optimisation methods such as mathematical programming and evolutionary algorithms that are competitive for static problems, since they are usually time consuming, and cannot give real-time responses. In this paper, we consider solving this problem using heuristics. A heuristic gradually builds a solution by adding the requests to the end of the route one by one. This way, it can take advantage of the latest information when making the next decision, and give immediate response. In this paper, we propose a meta-algorithm to generate a solution given any heuristic. The meta-algorithm maintains a set of routes throughout the scheduling horizon. Whenever a new request arrives, it tries to re-generate new routes to include the new request by the heuristic. It accepts the new request if successful, and reject otherwise. Then we manually designed several heuristics, and proposed a genetic programming-based hyper-heuristic to automatically evolve heuristics. The results showed that the heuristics evolved by genetic programming significantly outperformed the manually designed heuristics.</p></span></span></span></li>

GE can use a diversity of search strategies including Swarm Intelligence (SI). Bee Swarm Optimization (BSO) is part of SI and it tries to solve the main problems of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO): the premature convergence and the poor diversity. In this paper we propose using BSO as part of GE as strategies to generate heuristics that solve the Bin Packing Problem (BPP). A comparison between BSO, PSO, and BPP heuristics is performed through the nonparametric Friedman test. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a way to implement different algorithms as search strategy in GE. In this paper, it is proposed that the BSO obtains better results than the ones obtained by PSO, also there is a grammar proposed to generate online and offline heuristics to improve the heuristics generated by other grammars and humans.</p></span></span></span></li>

In a DJSS problem instance, jobs arrive on the shop floor to be processed on specific sequences of machines on the shop floor and unforeseen events such as dynamic job arrivals and machine breakdown occur that affect the properties of the shop floor. Many researchers have proposed genetic programming based hyper-heuristic (GP-HH) approaches to evolve high quality dispatching rules for DJSS problems with dynamic job arrivals, outperforming good man-made rules for the problems. However, no GP-HH approaches have been proposed for DJSS problems with dynamic job arrivals and machine breakdowns, and it is not known how well GP generalises over both DJSS problem instances with no machine breakdown to problem instances with machine breakdown. Therefore, this paper investigates the generality of GP for DJSS problem with dynamic job arrivals and machine breakdowns. To do this, a machine breakdown specific DJSS dataset is proposed, and an analysis procedure is used to observe the differences in the structures of the GP rules when evolved under different machine breakdown scenarios. The results show that performance and the distributions of the terminals for the evolved rules is sensitive to the frequency of machine breakdowns in the training instances used to evolve the rules</p></span></span></span></li>

This article presents a comparison between state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics and a newly proposed iterated variable neighborhood descent algorithm when solving the course timetabling problem. Our formulation can be seen as an adaptive iterated local search algorithm that combines several move operators in the improvement stage. Our improvement stage not only uses several neighborhoods, but it also incorporates state-of-the-art reinforcement learning mechanisms to adaptively select them on the fly. Our approach substitutes the adaptive improvement stage by a variable neighborhood descent (VND) algorithm. VND is an ingredient of the more general variable neighborhood search (VNS), a powerful metaheuristic that systematically exploits the idea of neighborhood change. This leads to a more effective search process according course timetabling benchmark results.</p></span></span></span></li>

As a chosen 'expert' hyper-heuristic is run on a small set of training problem instances, data is collected to learn from the expert regarding how to decide which low-level heuristic to select and apply to the solution in hand during the search process. In this study, a Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) is used to extract hidden patterns within the collected data in the form of a classifier ,i.e an 'apprentice' hyper-heuristic, which is then used to solve the 'unseen' problem instances. Firstly, the parameters of TDNN are tuned using Taguchi orthogonal array as a design of experiments method. Then the influence of extending and enriching the information collected from the expert and fed into TDNN is explored on the behaviour of the generated apprentice hyper-heuristic. The empirical results show that the use of distance between solutions as an additional information collected from the expert generates an apprentice which outperforms the expert algorithm on a benchmark of OVRP instances.</p></span></span></span></li>

Even though the manufacturing environment is uncertain, most of the existing research works consider merely deterministic problems where the time required for processing any job is known in advance and never changes. However many DJSS problems in practice involve high level of uncertainty that must be explicitly addressed. In this work, we consider DJSS problems with varied uncertainty configurations of machines in terms of processing times. We find that with the varying levels of uncertainty, more and more machines cannot fulfill their duties as scheduled and will become bottlenecks of the job shop. To cope with uncertainties, it is therefore essential to identify these bottleneck machines and schedule the jobs to be performed by them carefully. Driven by this idea, we develop a new effective method to evolve pairs of dispatching rules each for a different bottleneck level on the machines. A clustering approach to classify the bottleneck level of the machines arising in the system due to uncertain processing times is proposed. Then, a cooperative co-evolution technique to evolve pairs of dispatching rules which generalizes well across different uncertainty configurations is presented. We perform empirical analysis to show its generalization characteristic over the different uncertainty configurations and show that the proposed method outperforms the current approaches.</p></span></span></span></li>

Good solutions to operations research problems can make a large difference to the efficient running of businesses and organisations and so the field often searches for new methods to improve these solutions. The high school timetabling problem is an example of an operations research problem and is a challenging task which requires assigning events and resources to time slots subject to a set of constraints. In this paper a new sequence-based selection hyper-heuristic is presented that produces excellent results on a suite of high school timetabling problems. In this study, we present an easy-to-implement, easy-to-maintain and effective sequence-based selection hyper-heuristic to solve high school timetabling problems using a benchmark of unified real-world instances collected from different countries. We show that with sequence-based methods, it is possible to discover new best known solutions for a number of the problems in the timetabling domain. Through this investigation, the usefulness of sequence-based selection hyper-heuristics has been demonstrated and the capability of these methods has been shown to exceed the state-of-the-art.</p></span></span></span></li>

Since it is a practical decision-making problem with high complexity and large problem instances, a hybrid evolutionary hyper-heuristic (HEH) approach, which combines heuristic generation and heuristic selection, is developed in this paper. In order to increase the diversity and effectiveness of heuristic rules, genetic programming is used to automatically generate new rules based on the attributes of parts, machines, and vehicles. The new rules are added to the candidate rule set, and a rule selection genetic algorithm is developed to choose appropriate rules for machines and vehicles. Finally, scheduling solutions are obtained using the selected rules. A comparative evaluation is conducted, with some state-of-the-art hyper-heuristic approaches which lack some of the strategies proposed in HEH, with a meta-heuristic approach that is suitable for large scale scheduling problems, and with adaptations of some well-known heuristic rules. Computational results show that the new rules generated in HEH have similarities to the best-performing human-made rules, but are more effective due to the evolutionary processes in HEH. Moreover, the HEH approach has advantages over other approaches in both computational efficiency and solution quality, and is especially suitable for problems with large instance sizes. Note to Practitioners-Our survey of the equipment manufacturing industry in China indicates that, for complex products like synthetic transmission devices, intercell transfers occur in the processing routes of more than 51% of parts. More than 47% of tardy parts are caused by inefficient intercell cooperation. Therefore, intercell transfers are inevitable and it is worth an effort to find out an effective approach to intercell scheduling. To solv- intercell scheduling problems, two characteristics in industrial environments of complex products cannot be neglected. The first one is the large problem sizes, which involve up to hundreds of parts and thousands of operations; and the second one is the importance of transportation to intercell scheduling, which involves allocation and utilization of vehicles. However, sufficient transportation capacity is taken as a common assumption in most of research with respect to intercell scheduling, which shields the transportation dimension and hinders the application of these intercell scheduling approaches. Therefore, intercell scheduling with limited transportation capacity is considered, and a hybrid evolutionary hyper-heuristic is proposed in this paper. The advantages of this approach lie in that, (i) as a hyper-heuristic, it provides high computational efficiency, which is suitable for industrial environments with large problem sizes; and (ii) genetic programming is employed to generate problem-specific heuristic rules, which enhances the learning and searching ability of the approach. We compare the proposed approach with the man-made heuristic rules that are widely used in practice. Experimental results indicate that, for hundreds of parts and thousands of operations, given the same running time, our approach outperforms man-made rules with an average gap of 60.6% in minimizing total weighted tardiness. Therefore, our approach is advantageous in both computational efficiency and solution quality, and is especially suitable for the intercell scheduling problems in practice.</p></span></span></span></li>

In this work, a hyper-heuristic is evaluated for a transportation problem.

The ensemble adopts a divide-and-conquer approach in which each heuristic solves a unique subset of the instance set considered. NELLI-GP extends an existing ensemble method called NELLI by introducing a novel heuristic generator that evolves heuristics composed of linear sequences of dispatching rules: each rule is represented using a tree structure and is itself evolved. Following a training period, the ensemble is shown to outperform both existing dispatching rules and a standard genetic programming algorithm on a large set of new test instances. In addition, it obtains superior results on a set of 210 benchmark problems from the literature when compared to two state-of-the-art hyperheuristic approaches. Further analysis of the relationship between heuristics in the evolved ensemble and the instances each solves provides new insights into features that might describe similar instances.</p></span></span></span></li>

The most common way to solve this problem involves the use of heuristics that guide the search into promising areas of the space. In this article, we present a novel way to combine the strengths of distinct heuristics to produce solution methods that perform better than such heuristics on a wider range of instances. The methodology proposed produces neural networks that represent hyper-heuristics for variable ordering in constraint satisfaction problems. These neural networks are generated and trained by running a genetic algorithm that has the task of evolving the topology of the networks and some of their learning parameters. The results obtained suggest that the produced neural networks represent a feasible alternative for coding hyper-heuristics that control the use of different heuristics in such a way that the cost of the search is minimized.</p></span></span></span></li>

HHH is able to capitalize on the strengths and limit the deficiencies of each individual algorithm in a collective and synergistic manner. Unlike existing hyper-heuristics, HHH relies on three defined operators, based on improvement, intensification and diversification, to adaptively select the most suitable meta-heuristic at any particular time. Our results are promising as HHH manages to outperform existing t-way strategies on many of the benchmarks.</p></span></span></span></li>

In a selection hyper-heuristic framework, a heuristic is chosen from an existing set of low-level heuristics and applied to the current solution to produce a new solution at each point in the search. The use of crossover low-level heuristics is possible in an increasing number of general-purpose hyper-heuristic tools such as HyFlex and Hyperion. However, little work has been undertaken to assess how best to utilise it. Since a single-point search hyper-heuristic operates on a single candidate solution, and two candidate solutions are required for crossover, a mechanism is required to control the choice of the other solution. The frameworks we propose maintain a list of potential solutions for use in crossover. We investigate the use of such lists at two conceptual levels. First, crossover is controlled at the hyper-heuristic level where no problem-specific information is required. Second, it is controlled at the problem domain level where problem-specific information is used to produce good-quality solutions to use in crossover. A number of selection hyper-heuristics are compared using these frameworks over three benchmark libraries with varying properties for an NP-hard optimisation problem: the multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problem. It is shown that allowing crossover to be managed at the domain level outperforms managing crossover at the hyper-heuristic level in this problem domain.</p></span></span></span></li>

The aim of this system is to combine the advantages of the hyper-heuristic for learning useful scheduling rules and the meta-heuristic for further refining the solutions from the obtained rules.

Methods: We proved this problem is NP-complete problem and used heuristic algorithms to solve it. When the data set is small, most existing algorithms can reach the optimal solution using linear programming. However, traditional greedy algorithm and off-trap strategy fail to give reasonable results in large data set. In this study, we used the algorithm with appropriate oblivion strategy for efficient convergence and optimal solution. Results: To compare different algorithms, synthetic data sets of different size and a year's clinical data set provided by the hospital were used. The outcome of our algorithm was closely matched to the optimal solution from linear programming for sixty synthetic data sets. In addition, our algorithm is more efficient than that of linear programming when clinical data set was used. Meanwhile we found that the outcome is an approximate optimal solution and the algorithm is able to save a lot of cost for the hospital in practice. Conclusions: In this paper, we analyzed the results obtained from the algorithms of data set of different size and found that the algorithm can handle large volumes of data efficiently and reduce cost of hospitals.</p></span></span></span></li>

Such composite applications commonly are represented as workflows. Workflow scheduling is a well-known optimization problem, for which there is a great amount of solutions. Most of the algorithms contain parameters, which affect the result of a method. Thus, for the efficient scheduling it is important to tune parameters of the algorithms. Moreover, performance models, which are used for the estimation of obtained solutions, are crucial parts of workflow scheduling. In this work we present a combined approach for automatic parameters tuning and performance models construction in the background of the WMS lifecycle. Algorithms tuning is provided by hyper-heuristic genetic algorithm, whereas models construction is performed via symbolic regression methods. Developed algorithm was evaluated using CLAVIRE platform and is applicable for any distributed computing systems to optimize the execution of composite applications.</p></span></span></span></li>

Such spanning tree includes only one vertex from each cluster. Despite the diverse practical applications for this problem, the NP-hardness continues to be a computational challenge. Good quality solutions for some instances of the problem have been found by combining specific heuristics or by including them within a metaheuristic. However studied combinations correspond to a subset of all possible combinations. In this study a technique based on a genotype-phenotype genetic algorithm to automatically construct new algorithms for the problem, which contain combinations of heuristics, is presented. The produced algorithms are competitive in terms of the quality of the solution obtained. This emerges from the comparison of the performance with problem-specific heuristics and with metaheuristic approaches.</p></span></span></span></li>

The overall goal is maximising the average bin fullness. We investigate a 'policy matrix' representation, which assigns a score for each decision option independently and the option with the highest value is chosen, for one-dimensional online bin packing. A policy matrix might also be considered as a heuristic with many parameters, where each parameter value is a score. We hence effectively investigate a framework which can be used for creating heuristics via many parameters. The proposed framework combines a Genetic Algorithm optimiser, which searches the space of heuristics in policy matrix form, and an online bin packing simulator, which acts as the evaluation function. The empirical results indicate the success of the proposed approach, providing the best solutions for almost all item sequence generators used during the experiments. We also present a novel fitness landscape analysis on the search space of policies. This study hence gives evidence of the potential for automated discovery by intelligent systems of powerful heuristics for online problems; reducing the need for expensive use of human expertise.</p></span></span></span></li>

Each neighborhood is accompanied by a weight value which represents the probability of being chosen at each iteration. These weights are fixed before the algorithm runs, and are considered as parameters of the algorithm. Given a set of instances, off-line tuning of the algorithm's parameters can be done by automated algorithm configuration tools (e.g., SMAC). However, the large number of neighborhoods can make the tuning expensive and difficult even when the number of parameters has been reduced by some intuition. In this work, we propose a systematic method to characterize each neighborhood's behaviours, representing them as a feature vector, and using cluster analysis to form similar groups of neighborhoods. The novelty of our characterization method is the ability of reflecting changes of behaviours according to hardness of different solution quality regions. We show that using neighborhood clusters instead of individual neighborhoods helps to reduce the parameter configuration space without misleading the search of the tuning procedure. Moreover, this method is problem-independent and potentially can be applied in similar contexts.</p></span></span></span></li>

Hyper-heuristics are used to generate a solution process rather than producing an immediate solution to a given problem. This process is a re-usable mechanism that can be applied both to seen and unseen problem instances. In this paper, we propose a selection hyper-heuristic process with the intention to rise the level of generality and solve consistently well a wide range of constraint satisfaction problems. The hyper-heuristic technique is based on a messy genetic algorithm that generates high-level heuristics formed by rules (condition -> heuristic). The high-level heuristics produced are seen to be good at solving instances from certain parts of the parameterized space of problems, producing results using effort comparable to the best single heuristic per instance. This is beneficial, as the choice of best heuristic varies from instance to instance, so the high-level heuristics are definitely preferable to selecting any one low-level heuristic for all instances. The results confirm the robustness of the proposed approach and how high-level heuristics trained for some specific classes of instances can also be applied to unseen classes without significant lost of efficiency. This paper contributes to the understanding of heuristics and the way they can be used in a collaborative way to benefit from their combined strengths.</p></span></span></span></li>

Modularity optimization is an interesting and valuable approach for detection of network communities in complex networks. Due to characteristics of the problem dealt with in this study, the exact solution methods consume much more time. Therefore, we propose six metaheuristic optimization algorithms, which each contain a modularity optimization approach. These algorithms are the original Bat Algorithm (BA), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), modified Big Bang-Big Crunch algorithm (BB-BC), improved Bat Algorithm based on the Differential Evolutionary algorithm (BADE), effective Hyperheuristic Differential Search Algorithm (HDSA) and Scatter Search algorithm based on the Genetic Algorithm (SSGA). Four of these algorithms (HDSA, BADE, SSGA, BB-BC) contain new methods, whereas the remaining two algorithms (BA and GSA) use original methods. To clearly demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms when solving the problems, experimental studies were conducted using nine real-world complex networks - five of which are social networks and the rest of which are biological networks. The algorithms were compared in terms of statistical significance. According to the obtained test results, the HDSA proposed in this study is more efficient and competitive than the other algorithms that were tested.</p></span></span></span></li>

The supply chain management (SCM) with cross-docks is both effective and efficient where no storage is facilitated at the cross-dock and the order-picking is replaced by fast consolidation. However, cross-docking involves interrelated operations such as vehicle routing and vehicle scheduling which require proper planning and synchronization. Traditional cross-docking methods treat the operations separately and overlook the potential advantage of cooperative planning. This paper proposes a bi-objective mathematical formulation for the cross-docking with the noted new challenges. As the addressed problem is highly constrained, we develop a cooperative coevolution approach consisting of Hyper-heuristics and Hybrid-heuristics for achieving continuous improvement in alternating objectives. The performance of our approach is illustrated with real geographical data and is compared with existing models. Statistical tests based on intensive simulations, including the convergence 95% confidence analysis and the worst-case analysis, are conducted to provide reliable performance guarantee.</p></span></span></span></li>

It is important to select a minimum number of products but, at the same time, to consider the coverage of testing criteria such as pairwise, among other factors. To solve such problems Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have been successfully applied. However, to design a solution for this and other software engineering problems can be very difficult, because it is necessary to choose among different search operators and parameters. Hyper-heuristics can help in this task, and have raised interest in the Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) field. Considering the growing adoption of SPL in the industry and crescent demand for SPL testing approaches, this paper introduces a hyper-heuristic approach to automatically derive products to variability testing of SPLs. The approach works with MOEAs and two selection methods, random and based on FRR-MAB (Fitness Rate Rank based Multi-Armed Bandit). It was evaluated with real FMs and the results show that the proposed approach outperforms the traditional algorithms used in the literature, and that both selection methods present similar performance.</p></span></span></span></li>

In such a learning environment that guides students to observe and learn from real-world targets, various physical world constraints need to be taken into account when planning learning paths for individuals. In this study, an optimization problem is formulated by taking the relevance of real-world learning targets and the environmental constraints into account when determining personalized learning paths in the real world to maximize students' learning efficacy. Moreover, a hyper-heuristic approach is proposed to efficiently find quality learning paths for individual students. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, the teachers' feedback was collected and analyzed based on the learning activities conducted in an elementary school natural science course; in addition, the performances of the proposed algorithm and other approaches were compared based on a set of test data.</p></span></span></span></li>

In this paper, we developed a three-level hyper-heuristic framework to generate algorithms for the problem. From elementary components and multiple sets of problem instances, algorithms are generated. The best algorithms are selected to go through a second step process, where they are evaluated with problem instances that differ in size and difficulty. The problem instances are generated according to methods that are found in the literature. In all of the larger problem instances, the generated algorithms have less than 1 % error with respect to the optimal solution. Additionally, generated algorithms are efficient, taking on average fractions of a second to find a solution for any instance, with a standard deviation of 1 s. In terms of structure, hyper-heuristic algorithms are compact in size compared with those in the literature, allowing an in-depth analysis of their structure and their presentation to the scientific world.</p></span></span></span></li>

This problem is finding effective features among the set of all features in such that the final feature set can improve accuracy and reduce complexity. Since feature selection is an NP-Hard problem, many heuristic algorithms have been studied so far to solve this problem.
In this paper, we propose a novel method based on hyper-heuristic approach to find an efficient proper feature subset which is named Hyper-Heuristic Feature Selection (HHFS). In the proposed method, Low level heuristics are categorized into two groups: the first group contains exploiters which cause to exploit the search space efficiently by improving the quality of the candidate solution at hand; the second one includes explorer heuristics which explore the solution space by dwelling on random perturbations. Since each region of the solution space can have its own characteristics, an appropriate low level heuristic should be selected and applied to the current solution. We propose Genetic Algorithm to select among the set of low level heuristic and balance between exploitation and exploration. It chooses the low level heuristic based on the existing functional history of low level heuristic. We aim to investigate the role of cooperation between low level heuristics within a hyper-heuristic framework to find the best feature subset. Since different low level heuristics have different strengths and weaknesses, we believe that cooperation can allow the strengths of one low level heuristic to compensate for the weaknesses of another. In this study, we also propose Adaptive Hyper-Heuristic Feature Selection (AHHFS) which is an extension of HHFS. Empirical study of the proposed method on several commonly used data sets from UCI repository indicates that it outperforms recent methods in the literature for feature selection.</p></span></span></span></li>

The paper reports on empirical evaluation of the performance of MHypEA with the reported results in the literature. The comparison is mainly based on two factors - quality of the obtained solutions and the computational effort.
On all the attempted problems, MHypEA reported good results in comparison to all the studies that were reported on multi-objective formulation of the problem, with a computational effort of nearly one-twentieth of the computational effort required by the other multi-objective algorithms.

Different policies exist to set up look-ahead methods differing in the object of inspection and in the extensiveness of the search. In this work, two original look-ahead strategies are developed and tested through numerical experiments. The first method introduces a look-ahead mechanism that acts as a hyper-heuristic for comparing and selecting local-search operators. The second method uses a look-ahead strategy on a lower level in order to guide a local-search metaheuristic. The proposed approaches are implemented using a hyper-heuristic framework. They are tested against alternative methods using two different competition benchmarks, including a comparison with results given in literature. Furthermore, in a second set of experiments, a detailed investigation regarding the influence of particular parameter values is executed for one method. The experiments reveal that the inclusion of a simple look-ahead principle into an iterated local-search procedure significantly improves the outcome regarding the considered benchmarks.</p></span></span></span></li>

The demand for each item is considered to be dependent not only on its and other items' allocated shelf space and displayed locations, but also on spatial relationships between items. Joint optimization models are developed for two different scenarios: (a) each item is replenished individually; and (b) multiple items are replenished jointly. A multi-stage simulated annealing (SA) based hyper-heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve both joint optimization models. These models are then evaluated numerically for different problem sizes. The results demonstrate that: (1) the proposed SA based hyper-heuristic algorithm is robust and efficient for both joint optimization models; and (2) the model for the joint replenishment policy leads to a higher profit than that of the model for the individual replenishment policy. Hence, the joint optimization model with joint replenishment policy will be helpful for retailers making decisions about shelf display arrangement and inventory control for multiple items.</p></span></span></span></li>

Instead of hand-tuning a standard metaheuristic to test the efficiency of the hybrid of the components, we chose to use an automated generation of a multi-component metaheuristic to save human time, and also improve objectivity in the analysis and comparisons of components. For this we designed a new metaheuristic schema which we call Conditional Markov Chain Search (CMCS). We show that CMCS is flexible enough to model several standard metaheuristics; this flexibility is controlled by multiple numeric parameters, and so is convenient for automated generation. We study the configurations revealed by our approach and show that the best of them outperforms the previous state-of-the-art BBQP algorithm by several orders of magnitude. In our experiments we use benchmark instances introduced in the preliminary version of this paper and described here, which have already become the de facto standard in the BBQP literature.</p></span></span></span></li>

This situation leads to a need of good machine scheduling system. Generally, production processes in textile industry belong to the flow shop scheduling problems (FSSP). Many approaches/heuristics have been proposed for solving FSSP. Two of them are Palmer's algorithm and Gupta's algorithm. This paper investigates a method, called genetic algorithm hyper-heuristic, for combining those heuristics in order to obtain some new better heuristics.

The GRASP is a well-known two-phase metaheuristic. First, a construction phase builds a complete solution iteratively, component by component, by a greedy randomized algorithm. After that, a local search phase improves this solution. The choice of a component and the order in which it is added in a solution mostly depend on its incremental cost. Thus, a basic GRASP configuration is defined by a cost function, a probabilistic parameter of greediness and a neighbourhood structure. We consider five cost functions and seven well-known neighbourhood structures. In this paper a cost function based on a bounding operator is integrated in GRASP for the first time. Mechanisms that investigate automatically algorithm configurations refer to hyper-heuristics. Our hyper-heuristic investigates 315 GRASP configurations and reports which one produces better results. Parallel multi-core computing is used as a way to efficiently implement the hyper-heuristic. Taillard's benchmark instances are used to test the hyper-heuristic for the permutation flow-shop problem.</p></span></span></span></li>

In this paper, the problem is defined as energy-constrained performance optimization and performance-constrained energy optimization. Task scheduling for precedence-constrained parallel applications represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in HMCSs is an NP-HARD problem. Over the last three decades, several task scheduling techniques have been developed for energy-aware scheduling. However, it is impossible for a single task scheduling technique to outperform all other techniques for all types of applications and situations. Motivated by these observations, hyperheuristic framework is introduced. Moreover, a quantum-inspired high-level learning strategy is proposed to improve the performance of this framework. Meanwhile, a fast solution evaluation technique is designed to reduce the computational burden for each iteration step. Experimental results show that the fast solution evaluation technique can improve average algorithm search speed by 38 percent and that the proposed algorithm generally exhibits outstanding convergence performance.</p></span></span></span></li>

Feature selection is a problem of finding efficient features among all features in which the final feature set can improve accuracy and reduce complexity. One way to solve this problem is to evaluate all possible feature subsets. However, evaluating all possible feature subsets is an exhaustive search and thus it has high computational complexity. Until now many heuristic algorithms have been studied for solving this problem. Hyper-heuristic is a new heuristic approach which can search the solution space effectively by applying local searches appropriately. Each local search is a neighborhood searching algorithm. Since each region of the solution space can have its own characteristics, it should be chosen an appropriate local search and apply it to current solution. This task is tackled to a supervisor. The supervisor chooses a local search based on the functional history of local searches. By doing this task, it can trade of between exploitation and exploration. Since the existing heuristic cannot trade of between exploration and exploitation appropriately, the solution space has not been searched appropriately in these methods and thus they have low convergence rate. For the first time, in this paper use a hyper-heuristic approach to find an efficient feature subset. In the proposed method, genetic algorithm is used as a supervisor and 16 heuristic algorithms are used as local searches. Empirical study of the proposed method on several commonly used data sets from UCI data sets indicates that it outperforms recent existing methods in the literature for feature selection.</p></span></span></span></li>

This study presents a heuristic scheduling algorithm, called High performance hyper-heuristic scheduling algorithm (HHSA) using detection operator, to find better scheduling solutions for real and cloud computing systems. The two operators - diversity detection and improvement detection operators - are employed in this algorithm to determine the timing to determine the heuristic algorithm. These two are employed to dynamically determine a low level heuristic that can be used to find better solution. To evaluate the performance of this method, authors examined the above method with several scheduling algorithms and results prove that Hyper Heuristic Scheduling Algorithm can significantly decrease the makespan of task scheduling when compared with all other scheduling algorithms. A novel high-performance hyper-heuristic algorithm is proposed for scheduling on cloud computing systems to reduce the makespan. This algorithm can be applied to both sequence dependent and sequence independent scheduling problems.</p></span></span></span></li>

In a systematic review of Max-Cut and Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) heuristics papers, we found only 4% publish source code, only 14% compare heuristics with identical termination criteria, and most experiments are performed with an artificial, homogeneous set of problem instances. To address these limitations, we implement and release as open-source a code-base of 10 MaxCut and 27 QUBO heuristics. We perform heuristic evaluation using cloud computing across a library of 3,296 instances. This large-scale evaluation provides insight into the types of problem instances for which each heuristic performs well or poorly. Because no single heuristic outperforms all others across all problem instances, we use machine learning to predict which heuristic will work best on a previously unseen problem instance, a key question facing practitioners.</p></span></span></span></li>

The vast majority of approaches apply selective hyper-heuristic methods that iteratively choose appropriate heuristics from a fixed set of pre-defined low-level heuristics to either build or perturb a candidate solution. We propose a novel hyper-heuristic called GP-MHH that operates in two stages. The first stage uses a novel Genetic Programming (GP) approach to evolve high quality constructive heuristics; these can be used with any existing method that relies on a candidate solution(s) as its starting point. In the second stage, a perturbative hyper-heuristic is applied to candidate solutions created from the new heuristics. The new constructive heuristics are shown to outperform existing low-level heuristics. When combined with a naive perturbative hyper-heuristic they provide results which are both competitive with known optimal values and outperform a recent method that also designs new heuristics on some standard benchmarks. Finally, we provide results on a set of rich VRPs, showing the generality of the approach.</p></span></span></span></li>

One of the design decisions that often has to be made when developing intelligent systems is the low-level construction heuristic to use. These are usually rules of thumb derived based on human intuition. Generally a heuristic is derived for a particular domain. However, according to the no free lunch theorem different low-level heuristics will be effective for different problem instances. Deriving low-level heuristics for problem instances will be time consuming and hence we examine the automatic induction of low-level heuristics using hyper-heuristics. We investigate this for classical artificial intelligence. At the inception of the field of artificial intelligence search methods to solve problems were generally uninformed, such as the depth first and breadth first searches, and did not take any domain specific knowledge into consideration. As the field matured domain specific knowledge in the form of heuristics were used to guide the search, thereby reducing the search space. Search methods using heuristics to guide the search became known as informed searches, such as the best-first search, hill-climbing and the A* algorithm. Heuristics used by these searches are problem specific rules of thumb created by humans. This study investigates the use of a generative hyper-heuristic to derive these heuristics. The hyper-heuristic employs genetic programming to evolve the heuristics. The approach was tested on two classical artificial intelligence problems, namely, the 8-puzzle problem and Towers of Hanoi. The genetic programming system was able to evolve heuristics that produced solutions for 20 8-puzzle problems and 5 instances of Towers of Hanoi. Furthermore, the heuristics induced were able to produce solutions to the instances of the 8-puzzle problem which could not be solved using the A* algorithm with the number of tiles out of place heuristic and at least one admissible heuristic was evolved for all 25 problems.</p></span></span></span></li>

In this paper, a hyper-heuristic is proposed to solve the ski-lodge problem which involves allocating shared-time apartments to customers during a skiing season in a way that achieves a certain objective while respecting the constraints of the problem. Prior approaches to the problem include simulated annealing and genetic algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the ski-lodge problem is approached from a hyper-heuristic perspective. Although the aim of hyper-heuristics is to provide good results over problem sets rather than producing best results for certain problem instances, for completeness and to get an idea of the quality of solutions, the results of the proposed hyper-heuristic are compared to that of genetic algorithm and simulated annealing. The hyper-heuristic was found to perform better than simulated annealing and comparatively to the genetic algorithm, producing better results for some of the instances. Furthermore, the hyper-heuristic has better overall performance over the problem set being considered.</p></span></span></span></li>

Three low-level heuristics are defined and used as building blocks of the HH. Based on the newly defined building blocks and fitness evaluation function, the Self-Learning Gene Expression Programming (SL-GEP) is utilized to automatically evolve a suitable HH. To test its effectiveness, the proposed framework is applied to learn suitable HHs based on real video data.

An evolutionary algorithm's performance can be improved by utilizing operators called domain-specific heuristics that incorporate domain knowledge, but existing knowledge-intensive algorithms utilize one or two domain-specific heuristics, which limits the amount of incorporated knowledge or treats all knowledge as equally effective. We propose a hyperheuristic approach that efficiently utilizes multiple domain-specific heuristics that incorporate knowledge from different sources by allocating computational resources to the effective ones. Furthermore, a hyperheuristic allows the simultaneous use of conventional evolutionary operators that assist in escaping local optima. This paper empirically demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed hyperheuristic approach on a multi-objective design problem for an Earth observation satellite system. Results show that the hyperheuristic approach significantly improves the search performance compared to an evolutionary algorithm that does not use any domain knowledge.</p></span></span></span></li>

Commonly, these models have been addressed in the literature by applying unsatisfactory techniques, based essentially on combinatorial NP-hard problems. Recently, some heuristics have been introduced to solve these situations. This work improves on previous heuristics for the generation of valid solutions. More valid solutions are generated and with lower execution time. A parameterized scheme of metaheuristics is developed to improve the solutions obtained through heuristics. A hyper-heuristic is used over the parameterized scheme. The hyper-heuristic searches in a space of metaheuristics and generates metaheuristics that provide solutions close to the optimum. The method is competitive versus exact methods, and has a lower execution time.</p></span></span></span></li>

Thompson Sampling is a machine learning mechanism interacting with the search environment to adapt its behaviour through trial-and-error. Despite the fact that it originated in the 1930s, the work on Thompson Sampling in the literature on search heuristics is limited. This paper is the first study investigating the Thompson Sampling approach in the field of hyper-heuristics.

A common issue with the application of a memetic algorithm is determining the best initial setting for the algorithmic parameters, but these can greatly influence its overall performance. Unlike traditional studies where parameters are tuned for a particular problem domain, in this study we do tuning that is applicable to cross-domain search. We extend previous work by tuning the parameters of a steady state memetic algorithm via a 'design of experiments' approach and provide surprising empirical results across nine problem domains, using a cross-domain heuristic search tool, namely HyFlex. The parameter tuning results show that tuning has value for cross-domain search. As a side gain, the results suggest that the crossover operators should not be used and, more interestingly, that single point based search should be preferred over a population based search, turning the overall approach into an iterated local search algorithm. The use of the improved parameter settings greatly enhanced the crossdomain performance of the algorithm, converting it from a poor performer in previous work to one of the stronger competitors.</p></span></span></span></li>

Even when they make a difference regarding metaheuristics under this perspective, proposals in literature commonly expose parameters for controlling their behavior such as metaheuristics does. Several internal mechanisms for automatically adapt those parameters can be implemented, but they require extra design effort and their validation no necessarily is generalizable to multiple domains. Such effort is prohibitive for their practical application on decision-support systems. Rather than implementing internal adapting mechanisms, the exploration of automatic parameter configuration through external tools is performed in this work. A new hyper-heuristic implementation based on a elite set of solutions was implemented and automatically configured with SMAC (Sequential Model-Based Algorithm Configuration), a state-of-art tool for automatic parameter configuration. Experiments with and without automated configuration are performed over the Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP). Comparative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the tool for improving the algorithm performance. Additionally, results provided insights that configurations applied over subsets of instances could provide better improvements in the algorithm performance.</p></span></span></span></li>

Each neighborhood is accompanied by a weight value which represents the probability of being chosen at each iteration. These weights are fixed before the algorithm runs, and can be tuned by off-the-shelf off-line automated algorithm configuration tools (e.g., SMAC). However, the large number of parameters might deteriorate the tuning tool's efficiency, especially in our case where each run of the algorithm is not computationally cheap, even when the number of parameters has been reduced by some intuition. In this work, we propose a systematic method to characterize each neighborhood's behaviours, representing them as a feature vector, and using cluster analysis to form similar groups of neighborhoods. The novelty of our characterization method is the ability of reflecting changes of behaviours according to hardness of different solution quality regions based on simple statistics collected during any algorithm runs. We show that using neighborhood clusters instead of individual neighborhoods helps to reduce the parameter configuration space without misleading the search of the tuning procedure. Moreover, this method is problem-independent and potentially can be applied in similar contexts.</p></span></span></span></li>

As a first step in addressing the problem, this paper presents a new web services selection/composition model which enables such a hyper-heuristic notion. Various parts of this proposed model can be implemented by using different algorithms thus enabling many hybrid implementations. In this paper the proposed model has been implemented by using a reference score and trust based service selection algorithm and a strategic tree based service composition algorithm. To realize this implementation agent based architecture has been proposed. A well defined QOS model has been used to accurately receive customer's request and update service specific quality values. The algorithms implemented are efficient as the computational complexities of these algorithms have been greatly reduced and also a fault tolerant approach has been adopted.

These ranges are further processed to determine a portfolio of parameter configurations, which would be used within two online Algorithm Selection approaches for solving different instances of a given combinatorial optimization problem effectively. We apply our approach on a Simulated Annealing-Tabu Search (SA-TS) hybrid algorithm for solving the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) as well as an Iterated Local Search (ILS) on the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).

These construction heuristics are usually derived by humans and this is usually quite a time consuming task. Furthermore, according to the no free lunch theorem different heuristics are effective for different problem instances. Ideally we would like to derive construction heuristics for different problem instances or classes of problems. However, due to the time it takes to manually derive construction heuristics it is generally not feasible to induce problem instance specific heuristics. The research presented in the paper forms part of the initiative aimed at automating the derivation of construction heuristics. Genetic programming is used to evolve construction heuristics for the curriculum based university course timetabling (CB-CTT) problem. Each heuristic is a hierarchical combination of problem characteristics and a period selection heuristic. The paper firstly presents and analyses the performance of known construction heuristics for CB-CTT. The analysis has shown that different heuristics are effective for different problem instances. The paper then presents the genetic programming approach for the automated induction of construction heuristics for the CB-CTT problem and evaluates the approach on the ITC 2007 problem instances for the second international timetabling competition. The evolved heuristics performed better than the known construction heuristics, producing timetables with lower soft constraint costs.</p></span></span></span></li>

The basic idea of hyper-heuristics is based on searching for search-strategy. Instead of traversing the solution-space, the hyper-heuristic traverses the space of algorithms to find or construct an algorithm best suited for the given problem instance. The observed efficiency of hyper-heuristics is not yet fully explained on the theoretical level. The leading hypothesis suggests that the fitness landscape of the algorithm-space is more favorable to local search techniques than the original space.

In this paper, we analyse properties of fitness landscapes of the problem of minimal vertex cover. We focus on properties that are related to efficiency of metaheuristics such as locality and fitness-distance correlation. We compare properties of the original space and the algorithm space trying to verify the hypothesis explaining hyper-heuristics performance. Our analysis shows that the hyper-heuristic space really has some more favorable properties than the original space.</p></span></span></span></li>

This paper focuses on a dynamic JSS problem to minimise the total weighted tardiness. In dynamic JSS, attributes of a job are only revealed after it arrives at the shop floor. Dispatching rule heuristics are prominent approaches to dynamic JSS problems, and Genetic Programming based Hyper-heuristic (GP-HH) approaches have been proposed to automatically generate effective dispatching rules for dynamic JSS problems. Research on static JSS problems shows that high quality ensembles of dispatching rules can be evolved by a GP-HH that uses cooperative coevolution. Therefore, we compare two coevolutionary GP approaches to evolve ensembles of dispatching rules for dynamic JSS problems. First, we adapt the Multilevel Genetic Programming (MLGP) approach, which has never been applied to JSS problems. Second, we extend an existing approach for a static JSS problem, called Ensemble Genetic Programming for Job Shop Scheduling (EGP-JSS), by adding "less-myopic" terminals that take job and machine attributes outside of the scope of the attributes commonly used in the literature. The results show that MLGP for JSS evolves ensembles that are significantly better than single "less-myopic" rules evolved using GP with only little difference in computation time. In addition, the rules evolved using EGP-JSS perform better than the MLGP-JSS rules, but MLGP-JSS evolves rules significantly faster than EGP-JSS.</p></span></span></span></li>

Method: The systemizing framework consists of performing a systematic mapping study (SM), following a 3-steped protocol. Results: 371 primary studies have been depicted from the multi-stage search and filtering process, to which inclusion and exclusion criteria have been applied. Results have been visually mapped in several distributions.

Stochastic
tree search algorithms, like Monte Carlo Tree Search, perform relatively well on this task. However, performance is nontransitive: different agents perform best in different games, which means that there is not a single agent that is the best in all the games. Rather, some types of games are dominated by a few agents whereas other different agents dominate other types of games. Thus, it should be possible to construct a hyper-agent that selects from a portfolio, in which constituent sub-agents will play a new game best. Since there is no knowledge about the games, the agent needs to use available features to predict the most suitable algorithm. This work constructs such a hyper-agent using the General Video Game Playing Framework (GVGAI).

Structural conservation serves as strong evidence for important RNA functionality. Thus, comparative structure analysis is the gold standard for the discovery and interpretation of functional RNAs.In this paper we focus on one of the functional RNA motif types, sequence-structure motifs in RNA molecules, which marks the molecule as targets to be recognized by other molecules.We present a new approach for the detection of RNA structure (including pseudoknots), which is conserved among a set of unaligned RNA sequences. Our method extends previous approaches for this problem, which were based on first identifying conserved stems and then assembling them into complex structural motifs. The novelty of our approach is in simultaneously preforming both the identification and the assembly of these stems. We believe this novel unified approach offers a more informative model for deciphering the evolution of functional RNAs, where the sets of stems comprising a conserved motif co-evolve as a correlated functional unit.Since the task of mining RNA sequence-structure motifs can be addressed by solving the maximum weighted clique problem in an n-partite graph, we translate the maximum weighted clique problem into a state graph. Then, we gather and define domain knowledge and low-level heuristics for this domain. Finally, we learn hyper-heuristics for this domain, which can be used with heuristic search algorithms (e.g., A*, IDA*) for the mining task.The hyper-heuristics are evolved using HH-Evolver, a tool for domain-specific, hyper-heuristic evolution. Our approach is designed to overcome the computational limitations of current algorithms, and to remove the necessity of previous assumptions that were used for sparsifying the graph.This is still work in progress and as yet we have no results to report. However, given the interest in the methodology and its previous success in other domains we are hopeful that these shall be forthcoming soon.</p></span></span></span></li>

Several experimental studies have used additive reinforcement learning mechanisms, however, these are inconclusive with regard to the performance of selection hyper-heuristics with these learning mechanisms. This paper points out limitations to learning with additive reinforcement learning mechanisms. Our theoretical results show that if the probability of improving the candidate solution in each point of the search process is less than 1 / 2 which is a mild assumption, then additive reinforcement learning mechanisms perform asymptotically similar to the simple random mechanism which chooses heuristics uniformly at random. In addition, frequently used adaptation schemes can affect the memory of reinforcement learning mechanisms negatively. We also conducted experiments on two well-known combinatorial optimisation problems, bin-packing and flow-shop, and the obtained results confirm the theoretical findings. This study suggests that alternatives to the additive updates in reinforcement learning mechanisms should be considered.</p></span></span></span></li>

Such points can be improved using Design Patterns, but despite their advantages, few works have explored their usage with metaheuristics and hyper-heuristics. In order to contribute to this research topic, we present a solution based on the Visitor pattern used to design genetic operators.

The results presented are comparable to those generated by state-of-the-art metaheuristics, as  well as a single-objective version of the algorithm from the literature. The information revealed from analysing  the sequences generated to solve the problem reveal important information about the nature of the problem space  that is not available from the metaheuristics, and the entire Pareto front can be explored in a single run as opposed  to the multiple runs needed with the original single-objective algorithm.</p></span></span></span></li>

The MOSSHH algorithm operates as a hidden Markov model, using transition probabilities to determine which low-level heuristic or sequence of heuristics should be applied next. By incorporating dominance into the transition probability update rule, and an elite archive of solutions, MOSSHH generates solutions to multi-objective problems that are competitive with bespoke multi-objective algorithms. When applied to test problems, it is able to find good approximations to the true Pareto front, and yields information about the type of low-level heuristics that it uses to solve the problem.</p></span></span></span></li>

Evolving ensembles using GP-HH for DJSS problem is a relatively unexplored area, and has been shown to outperform standard GP-HH procedures that evolve single rules. As a fitness sharing algorithm has not been applied to the specific GP-HH approach, we investigate four different phenotypic distance measures as part of a fitness sharing algorithm. The fitness sharing algorithm may potentially improve the diversity of the constituent members of the ensemble and improve the quality of the ensembles. The results show that the niched coevolutionary GP approaches evolve smaller sized rules than the base coevolutionary GP approaches, but have similar performances.</p></span></span></span></li>

Robots executing OHE use the different sources of feedback information traditionally associated with controller evaluation to find effective evolutionary algorithms and controllers online during task execution. We present two approaches: OHE-fitness, which uses the fitness score of controllers as the criterion to select promising algorithms over time, and OHE-diversity, which relies on the behavioural diversity of controllers for algorithm selection. Both OHE-fitness and OHE-diversity are distributed across groups of robots that evolve in parallel. We assess the performance of OHE-fitness and of OHE-diversity in two foraging tasks with differing complexity, and in five configurations of a dynamic phototaxis task with varying evolutionary pressures. Results show that our OHE approaches: (i) outperform multiple state-of-the-art algorithms as they facilitate controllers with superior performance and faster evolution of solutions, and (ii) can increase effectiveness at different stages of evolution by combining the benefits of multiple algorithms over time. Overall, our study shows that OHE is an effective new paradigm to the synthesis of controllers for robots.</p></span></span></span></li>

To reduce execution times, a shared-memory schema of hyperheuristics is used, with four levels of parallelism, with two being selected for the hyperheuristic and two for the metaheuristics. The parallel schema is executed in a many-core system in "native mode", and the four-level parallelism allows us to take full advantage of the massive parallelism offered by this architecture. An auto-tuning methodology is used to select the number of threads used at each level. A theoretical model of the execution time of the parameterized metaheuristic schema is developed, and the model is adapted to a particular metaheuristic by experimentation. The massive parallelism in a many-core system can help to obtain satisfactory fitness and an important reduction in execution times, for which the four-levels parallelism schema is useful, and the auto-tuning engine facilitates the optimum selection of the number of threads at each level. The best results are obtained with a relatively low number of threads distributed among the four levels of parallelism between the hyper and metaheuristics.</p></span></span></span></li>

We focus particularly on evolving energy-aware dispatching rules in the form of genetic programs that can schedule jobs for the purpose of minimizing total energy consumption, makespan and total tardiness in a job shop. To improve the opportunity of identifying desirable dispatching rules, we have also explored several alternative topologies of the island model.

HyFlex is a general purpose heuristic search API which separates the high level search control from the domain details enabling rapid development and performance comparison of heuristic search methods, particularly hyper-heuristics. In this study, the performance of six previously proposed selection hyper-heuristics are evaluated on three recently introduced extended HyFlex problem domains, namely 0-1 Knapsack, Quadratic Assignment and Max-Cut.

We in- corporate three comparison operators as alternatives to dominance and investigate their potential to optimise many-objective problems with a hyper-heuristic from the literature.

Here we investigate two frameworks, using Harmony Search to select a mixture of continuous and discrete variables forming the components of a Memetic Algorithm for cross-domain heuristic search. The first is a single-point based framework which maintains a single solution, updating the harmony memory based on performance from a fixed starting position. The second is a population-based method which co-evolves a set of solutions to a problem alongside a set of harmony vectors. This work examines the behaviour of each framework over thirty problem instances taken from six different, real-world problem domains. The results suggest that population co-evolution performs better in a time-constrained scenario, however both approaches are ultimately constrained by the underlying metaphors.</p></span></span></span></li>

Instead, we model this as a dynamic pickup and delivery problem with soft time windows (PDPSTW). We present the variable neighbourhood descent with memory (VNDM) hybrid metaheuristic (HM) and compare its performance against Q-learning (QL), binary exponential back off (BEBO) and random descent (RD) hyperheuristics on published benchmark and real-world instances of the PDPSTW. We find that VNDM consistently generates the highest quality solutions, with the fewest routes or shortest distances, amongst the methods tested.

Synchronous Parallel EAs (SPEAs) leverage this with the intent to gain significant speed-ups when executed on multiple processors. However, many important problem classes lead to large variations in fitness evaluation times, such as is often the case in hyper-heuristics where the time complexity of executing one individual may differ greatly from that of another. Asynchronous Parallel EAs (APEAs) omit the generational synchronization step of traditional EAs which work in well-defined cycles. They can provide scalability improvements proportional to the variation in fitness evaluation times of the evolved individuals, and therefore should be considered for use in hyper-heuristics. This paper provides an empirical analysis of the improvements obtained by applying APEAs, compared to SPEAs, on a case study involving the evolution of conflict-driven clause learning Boolean satisfiability solvers, demonstrating that APEAs are the future of hyper-heuristics.</p></span></span></span></li>

As an alternative, meta-heuristics emerged as an efficient way to solve this type of problems even though they cannot ensure optimal values. The main issue of meta-heuristics is that they are built using domain-specific knowledge, therefore they require a great effort to be used in a new domain. In order to solve this problem, the concept of Hyper-heuristics were proposed. Hyper-heuristics are search methods that aim to solve optimization problems by selecting or generating heuristics. Selection hyper-heuristics choose from a pool of heuristics a good one to be applied at the current stage of the optimization process. The selection mechanism is the main part of a selection hyper-heuristic and has a great impact on its performance. Although there are several works focused on selection hyperheuristics, there is no unanimity about which is the best way to define a selection strategy. In this dissertation, a deterministic selection strategy based on the concepts of the MultiArmed Bandit (MAB) problem is proposed to cross-domain optimization. Multi-armed bandit approaches define a selection function with two components, the first is based on the performance of an operator and the second based on the number of times that the operator was used. These approaches had showed a promising performance over the Adaptive Operator Selection context. However, there are few works on literature that aim the hyper-heuristic context, as proposed here. The proposed approach is integrated into the HyFlex framework, that was developed to facilitate the implementation and comparison of hyper-heuristics. An empirical parameter configuration was performed and the best setup was compared to the top ten CHeSC 2011 algorithms using the same methodology adopted during the competition. The results obtained were good comparable to those attained by the literature. Moreover, it was concluded that the behavior of MAB selection is heavily affected by its parameters. As this is not a desirable behavior to hyper-heuristics, future research will investigate ways to better deal with the parameter setting.</p></span></span></span></li>

Current conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) SAT solvers employ all-purpose heuristics for making decisions when finding truth assignments for arbitrary logical expressions called SAT instances. The instances derived from a particular problem class exhibit a unique underlying structure which impacts a solver's effectiveness. Thus, tailoring the solver heuristics to a particular problem class can significantly enhance the solver's performance; however, manual specialization is very labor intensive. Automated development may apply hyper-heuristics to search program space by utilizing problem-derived building blocks. This thesis demonstrates the potential for genetic programming (GP) powered hyper-heuristic driven automated design of algorithms to create tailored CDCL solvers, in this case through custom variable scoring and learnt clause scoring heuristics, with significantly better performance on targeted classes of SAT problem instances. As the run-time of GP is often dominated by fitness evaluation, evaluating multiple offspring in parallel typically reduces the time incurred by fitness evaluation proportional to the number of parallel processing units. The naive synchronous approach requires an entire generation to be evaluated before progressing to the next generation; as such, heterogeneity in the evaluation times will degrade the performance gain, as parallel processing units will have to idle until the longest evaluation has completed. This thesis shows empirical evidence justifying the employment of an asynchronous parallel model for GP powered hyper-heuristics applied to SAT solver space, rather than the generational synchronous alternative, for gaining speed-ups in evolution time. Additionally, this thesis explores the use of a multi-objective GP to reveal the trade-off surface between multiple CDCL attributes.</p></span></span></span></li>

The objective of these algorithms is not only to find suitable adjustments to the current population and hence the solution, but also to perform the process efficiently. However, a parameter setting that was optimal at the beginning of the algorithm may become unsuitable during the evolutionary process. Thus, it is preferable to automatically modify the control parameters during the runtime process. The approach required could have a bias on the distribution towards appropriate directions of the search space, thereby maintaining sufficient diversity among individuals in order to enable further ability of evolution. This thesis has offered an initial approach to developing this idea. The work starts from a clear understanding of the literature that is of direct relevance to the aforementioned motivations. The development of this approach has been built upon the basis of the fundamental and generic concepts of evolutionary algorithms. The work has exploited and benefited from a range of representative evolutionary computational mechanisms. In particular, essential issues in evolutionary algorithms such as parameter control, including the general aspects of parameter tuning and typical means for implementing parameter control have been investigated. Both the hyperheuristic algorithm and the memetic algorithm have set up a comparative work for the present development. This work has developed several novel techniques that contribute towards the advancement of evolutionary computation and optimization. One such novel approach is to construct a mixed strategy based on the concept of local fitness landscape. It exploits the concepts of fitness landscape and local fitness landscape. Both theoretical description and experimental investigation of this local fitness landscape-based mixed strategy have been provided, and systematic comparisons with alternative approaches carried out. Another contribution of this thesis is the innovative application of mixed strategy. This is facilitated by encompassing two mutation operators into the mixed strategy, which are borrowed from classical differential evolution techniques. Such an improved method has been shown to be simple and easy for implementation. The work has been utilised to deal with the problem of protein folding in bioinformatics. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm possesses an appropriate balance between exploration and exploitation. The use of this improved algorithm is less likely to fall into local optimal, entailing a faster and better convergence in resolving challenging realistic application problems.</p></span></span></span></li>

A job shop is a common manufacturing environment in which a schedule for processing a set of jobs through a set of machines needs to be constructed. Job shop scheduling (JSS) has been called a fascinating challenge as it is computationally hard and prevalent in the real-world. Developing more effective ways of scheduling jobs could increase profitability through increasing throughput and decreasing costs. Dispatching rules (DRs) are one of the most popular scheduling heuristics. DRs are easy to implement, have low computational cost, and cope well with the dynamic nature of real-world manufacturing environments.  However, the manual development of DRs is time consuming and requires expert knowledge of the scheduling environment. Genetic programming (GP) is an evolutionary computation method which is ideal for automatically discovering DRs. This is a hyper-heuristic approach, as GP is searching the search space of heuristic (DR) solutions rather than constructing a schedule directly.

The overall goal of this thesis is to develop GP based hyper-heuristics for the efficient evolution (automatic generation) of robust, reusable and effective scheduling heuristics for JSS environments, with greater interpretability.

Firstly, this thesis investigates using GP to evolve optimal DRs for the static two-machine JSS problem with makespan objective function. The results show that some evolved DRs were equivalent to an optimal scheduling algorithm. This validates both the GP based hyper-heuristic approach for generating DRs for JSS and the representation used.

Secondly, this thesis investigates developing ``less-myopic'' DRs through the use of wider-looking terminals and local search to provide additional fitness information. The results show that incorporating features of the state of the wider shop improves the mean performance of the best evolved DRs, and that the inclusion of local search in evaluation evolves DRs which make better decisions over the local time horizon, and attain lower total weighted tardiness.

Thirdly, this thesis proposes using strongly typed GP (STGP) to address the challenging issue of interpretability of DRs evolved by GP. Several grammars are investigated and the results show that the DRs evolved in the semantically constrained search space of STGP do not have (on average) performance that is as good as unconstrained. However, the interpretability of evolved rules is substantially improved.

Fourthly, this thesis investigates using multiobjective GP to encourage evolution of DRs which are more readily interpretable by human operators.  This approach evolves DRs with similar performance but smaller size. Fragment analysis identifies popular combinations of terminals which are then used as high level terminals; the inclusion of these terminals improved the mean performance of the best evolved DRs.

Through this thesis the following major contributions have been made: (1) the first use of GP to evolve optimal DRs for the static two-machine job shop with makespan objective function; (2) an approach to developing less-myopic DRs through the inclusion of wider looking terminals and the use of local search to provide additional fitness information over an extended decision horizon; (3) the first use of STGP for the automatic discovery of DRs with better interpretability and semantic validity for increased trust; and (4) the first multiobjective GP approach that considers multiple objectives  investigating the trade-off between scheduling behaviour and interpretability. This is also the first work that uses analysis of evolved GP individuals to perform feature selection and construction for JSS.</p></span></span></span></li>

This problem has many different applications such as mobile phones, TV broadcasting, radio and military operations. In this thesis, two variants of the FAP are considered, namely the static and the dynamic FAPs. The static FAP does not change over time, while the dynamic FAP changes over time as new requests gradually be-come known and frequencies need to be assigned to those requests effectively and promptly. The dynamic FAP has received little attention so far in the literature com-pared with the static FAP.

This thesis consists of two parts: the first part discusses and develops three heuristic algorithms, namely tabu search (TS), ant colony optimization (ACO) and hyper heuris-tic (HH), to solve the static FAP. These heuristic algorithms are chosen to represent different characteristics of heuristic algorithms in order to identify an appropriate solu-tion method for this problem. Several novel and existing techniques have been used to improve the performance of these heuristic algorithms. In terms of TS, one of the nov-el techniques aims to determine a lower bound on the number of frequencies that are required from each domain for a feasible solution to exist, based on the underlying graph colouring model. These lower bounds are used to ensure that we never waste time trying to find a feasible solution with a set of frequencies that do not satisfy the lower bounds, since there is no feasible solution in this search area. Another novel technique hybridises TS with multiple neighbourhood structures, one of which is used as a diversification technique. In terms of ACO, the concept of a well-known graph colouring algorithm, namely recursive largest first, is used. Moreover, some of the key factors in producing a high quality ACO implementation are examined such as differ-ent definitions of visibility and trail, and optimization of numerous parameters. In terms of HH, simple and advanced low level heuristics each with an associated inde-pendent tabu list are applied in this study. The lower bound on the number of fre-quencies that are required from each domain for a feasible solution to exist is also used.

Based on the experimental results, it is found that the best performing heuristic algo-rithm is TS, with HH also being competitive, whereas ACO achieves poor perfor-mance. Additionally, TS shows competitive performance compared with other algo-rithms in the literature.

In the second part of this thesis, various approaches are designed to solve the dynamic FAP. The best heuristic algorithms considered in the first part of this thesis are used to construct these approaches. It is interesting to investigate whether heuristic algorithms which work well on the static FAP also prove efficient on the dynamic FAP. Addi-tionally, several techniques are applied to improve the performance of these approach-es. One of these, called the Gap technique, is novel. This technique aims to identify a good frequency to be assigned to a given request. Based on the experimental results, it is found that the best approach for the dynamic FAP shows competitive results com-pared with other approaches in the literature. Finally, this thesis proposes a novel ap-proach to solve the static FAP by modelling it as a dynamic FAP through dividing this problem into smaller sub-problems, which are then solved in turn in a dynamic process. The lower bound on the number of frequencies that are required from each domain for a feasible solution to exist, based on the underlying graph colouring model, and the Gap technique are also used. The proposed approach shows the ability to improve the results which have been found by the heuristic algorithms in the first part of this thesis (which solve the static FAP as a whole). Moreover, it shows competitive results com-pared with other algorithms in the literature.</p></span></span></span></li>

Selecting a good combination of leader and archiving methods helps the algorithm to deal with the challenges caused by this increase in the number of objectives, but finding the most appropriate combination for a given problem is a hard task. To deal with this issue, previous works proposed the use of a simple hyper-heuristic to select dynamically a good combination of leader and archiving methods and achieved promising results. In this work, we hypothesize that by using more advanced heuristic selection methods we could further improve the performance of the algorithm. To investigate this hypothesis we conducted experimental studies comparing four heuristic selection methods. After selecting the best performing variant from this study, we conducted a second empirical study to compare this variant to a state-of-the- art optimizer, where the resulting algorithm outperformed it in most of the problems investigated.</p></span></span></span></li>

A traditional hyper-heuristic framework has two levels, namely, the high level strategy (heuristic selection mechanism and the acceptance criterion) and low level heuristics (a set of problem specific heuristics). Due to the different landscape structures of different problem instances, the high level strategy plays an important role in the design of a hyper-heuristic framework. In this paper, we propose a new high level strategy for a hyper-heuristic framework. The proposed high-level strategy utilizes a dynamic multiarmed bandit-extreme value-based reward as an online heuristic selection mechanism to select the appropriate heuristic to be applied at each iteration. In addition, we propose a gene expression programming framework to automatically generate the acceptance criterion for each problem instance, instead of using human-designed criteria. Two well-known, and very different, combinatorial optimization problems, one static (exam timetabling) and one dynamic (dynamic vehicle routing) are used to demonstrate the generality of the proposed framework. Compared with state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics and other bespoke methods, empirical results demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to generalize well across both domains. We obtain competitive, if not better results, when compared to the best known results obtained from other methods that have been presented in the scientific literature. We also compare our approach against the recently released hyper-heuristic competition test suite. We again demonstrate the generality of our approach when we compare against other methods that have utilized the same six benchmark datasets from this test suite.</p></span></span></span></li>

Selection hyper-heuristics are high level general purpose search methodologies that operate on a space formed by a set of low level heuristics rather than solutions. Most of the recently proposed selection hyper-heuristics are iterative and make use of two key methods which are employed successively; heuristic selection and move acceptance.

In this study, we present a novel generic selection hyper-heuristic framework containing a fixed set of reusable grouping low level heuristics and an unconventional move acceptance mechanism for solving grouping problems. This framework deals with one solution at a time at any given decision point during the search process. Also, a set of high quality solutions, capturing the trade-off between the number of groups and the additional objective for the given grouping problem, is maintained. The move acceptance mechanism embeds a local search approach which is capable of progressing improvements on those trade-off solutions.

The performance of different selection hyper-heuristics with various components under the proposed framework is investigated on graph colouring as a representative grouping problem. Then, the top performing hyper-heuristics are applied to a benchmark of examination timetabling instances. The empirical results indicate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed framework enabling grouping hyper-heuristics to achieve high quality solutions in both domains.</p></span></span></span></li>

Growth of Resource provisioning-based scheduling in large-scale distributed environments like Grid computing brings in new requirement challenges that are not being considered in traditional distributed computing environments. Resources being the backbone of the system, their efficient management plays quite an important role in its execution environment. Many constraints such as heterogeneity and dynamic nature of resources need to be taken care as steps toward managing Grid resources efficiently. The most important challenge in Grids being the job-resource mapping as per the users' requirement in the most secure way. The mapping of the jobs to appropriate resources for execution of the applications in Grid computing is found to be an NP-complete problem. Novel algorithm is required to schedule the jobs on the resources to provide reduced execution time, increased security and reliability. The main aim of this paper is to present an efficient strategy for secure scheduling of jobs on appropriate resources. A novel particle swarm optimization-based hyper-heuristic resource scheduling algorithm has been designed and used to schedule jobs effectively on available resources without violating any of the security norms. Performance of the proposed algorithm has also been evaluated through the GridSim toolkit. We have compared our resource scheduling algorithm with existing common heuristic-based scheduling algorithms experimentally. The results thus obtained have shown a better performance by our algorithm than the existing algorithms, in terms of giving more reduced cost and makespan of user's application being submitted to the Grids.</p></span></span></span></li>

The network is plastic in both its structure and content, leading to the following properties: it exploits existing knowledge captured in the network to rapidly produce solutions; it can adapt to new problems with widely differing characteristics; and it is capable of generalising over the problem space. The system is tested on a large corpus of 3,968 new instances of 1D bin-packing problems as well as on 1,370 existing problems from the literature; it shows excellent performance in terms of the quality of solutions obtained across the datasets and in adapting to dynamically changing sets of problem instances compared to previous approaches.

- The examination timetabling problem is an NP-hard problem. A large number of approaches for this problem are developed to find more appropriate search strategies. Hyper-heuristic is a kind of representative methods. In hyper-heuristic, the high-level search is executed to construct heuristic lists by traditional methods (such as Tabu search, variable neighborhoods and so on). The purpose of this paper is to apply the evolutionary strategy instead of traditional methods for high-level search to improve the capability of global search.

Design/methodology/approach
- This paper combines hyper-heuristic with evolutionary strategy to solve examination timetabling problems. First, four graph coloring heuristics are employed to construct heuristic lists. Within the evolutionary algorithm framework, the iterative initialization is utilized to improve the number of feasible solutions in the population; meanwhile, the crossover and mutation operators are applied to find potential heuristic lists in the heuristic space (high-level search). At last, two local search methods are combined to optimize the feasible solutions in the solution space (low-level search).

Findings
- Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach obtains competitive results and outperforms the compared approaches on some benchmark instances.

Originality/value
- The contribution of this paper is the development of a framework which combines evolutionary algorithm and hyper-heuristic for examination timetabling problems.</p></span></span></span></li>

A generic selection hyper-heuristic combines heuristic selection and move acceptance methods under an iterative single point-based search framework. At each step, the solution in hand is modified after applying a selected heuristic and a decision is made whether the new solution is accepted or not. In this study, we represent the trail of a hyper-heuristic as a third order tensor. Factorization of such a tensor reveals the latent relationships between the low level heuristics and the hyper-heuristic itself. The proposed learning approach partitions the set of low level heuristics into two subsets where heuristics in each subset are associated with a separate move acceptance method. Then a multi-stage hyper-heuristic is formed and while solving a given problem instance, heuristics are allowed to operate only in conjunction with the associated acceptance method at each stage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time tensor analysis of the space of heuristics is used as a data science approach to improve the performance of a hyper-heuristic in the prescribed manner. The empirical results across six different problem domains from a benchmark indeed indicate the success of the proposed approach.</p></span></span></span></li>

A transportation schedule must be constructed for a set of available vehicles, and several constraints have to be considered, particularly time windows, which define an upper and lower time bound for each customer request in which a vehicle must arrive to perform the service. Because of the complexity of DARPTW, a number of algorithms have been proposed for solving the problem, mainly based on metaheuristics such as Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing. In this work, a different approach for solving DARPTW is proposed, designed, and evaluated: hyperheuristics, which are alternative heuristic methods that operate at a higher abstraction level than metaheuristics, because rather than searching in the problem space directly, they search in a space of low-level heuristics to find the best strategy through which good solutions can be found. Although the proposed hyperheuristic uses simple and easy-to-implement operators, the experimental results demonstrate efficient and competitive performance on DARPTW when compared to other metaheuristics from the literature.</p></span></span></span></li>

In order to alleviate the complexity of designing metaheuristics, a methodology called hyper-heuristic has emerged as a possible solution.

Hyper-heuristics accomplish this through a high-level heuristic (heuristic selection mechanism and an acceptance criterion). This automates heuristic selection, deciding whether to accept or reject the returned solution. The fact that different problems, or even instances, have different landscape structures and complexity, the design of efficient high-level heuristics can have a dramatic impact on hyper-heuristic performance. In this paper, instead of using human knowledge to design the high-level heuristic, we propose a gene expression programming algorithm to automatically generate, during the instance-solving process, the high-level heuristic of the hyper-heuristic framework. The generated heuristic takes information (such as the quality of the generated solution and the improvement made) from the current problem state as input and decides which low-level heuristic should be selected and the acceptance or rejection of the resultant solution. The benefit of this framework is the ability to generate, for each instance, different high-level heuristics during the problem-solving process. Furthermore, in order to maintain solution diversity, we utilize a memory mechanism that contains a population of both high-quality and diverse solutions that is updated during the problem-solving process. The generality of the proposed hyper-heuristic is validated against six well-known combinatorial optimization problems, with very different landscapes, provided by the HyFlex software. Empirical results, comparing the proposed hyper-heuristic with state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics, conclude that the proposed hyper-heuristic generalizes well across all domains and achieves competitive, if not superior, results for several instances on all domains.</p></span></span></span></li>

An important variant of the problem requires scheduling of activities for multiple projects considering availability of local and global resources while respecting a range of constraints. This problem has been addressed by a competition, and associated set of benchmark instances, as a part of the MISTA 2013 conference. A critical aspect of the benchmarks is that the primary objective is to minimise the sum of the project completion times, with the usual makespan minimisation as a secondary objective. We observe that this leads to an expected different overall structure of good solutions and discuss the effects this has on the algorithm design. This paper presents the resulting competition winning approach; it is a carefully designed hybrid of Monte-Carlo tree search, novel neighbourhood moves, memetic algorithms, and hyper-heuristic methods. The implementation is also engineered to increase the speed with which iterations are performed, and to exploit the computing power of multicore machines. The resulting information-sharing multi-component algorithm significantly outperformed the other approaches during the competition, producing the best solution for 17 out of the 20 test instances and performing the best in around 90% of all the trials.</p></span></span></span></li>

Early detection of lung cancer is the leading factor in survival rate. All symptoms (features) of lung cancer do not appear until the cancer spreads to other areas. It needs an accurate early detection of lung cancer, for increasing the survival rate. For accurate detection, it need characterizes efficient features and delete redundancy features among all features. Feature selection is the problem of selecting informative features among all features. Materials and Methods: Lung cancer database consist of 32 patient records with 57 features. This database collected by Hong and Youngand indexed in the University of California Irvine repository. Experimental contents include the extracted from the clinical data and X-ray data, etc. The data described 3 types of pathological lung cancers and all features are taking an integer value 0-3. In our study, new method is proposed for identify efficient features of lung cancer. It is based on Hyper-Heuristic. Results: We obtained an accuracy of 80.63% using reduced 11 feature set. The proposed method compare to the accuracy of 5 machine learning feature selections. The accuracy of these 5 methods are 60.94, 57.81, 68.75, 60.94 and 68.75. Conclusions: The proposed method has better performance with the highest level of accuracy. Therefore, the proposed model is recommended for identifying an efficient symptom of Disease. These finding are very important in health research, particularly in allocation of medical resources for patients who predicted as high-risks.</p></span></span></span></li>

Design of such rules is usually done by experts in a time consuming trial-and-error process. Recently, evolutionary algorithms have been proposed to automate the design process. There are several possibilities to represent rules for this hyper-heuristic search. Because the representation determines the search neighborhood and the complexity of the rules that can be evolved, a suitable choice of representation is key for a successful evolutionary algorithm. In this paper we empirically compare three different representations, both numeric and symbolic, for automated rule design: A linear combination of attributes, a representation based on artificial neural networks, and a tree representation. Using appropriate evolutionary algorithms (CMA-ES for the neural network and linear representations, genetic programming for the tree representation), we empirically investigate the suitability of each representation in a dynamic stochastic job shop scenario. We also examine the robustness of the evolved dispatching rules against variations in the underlying job shop scenario, and visualize what the rules do, in order to get an intuitive understanding of their inner workings. Results indicate that the tree representation using an improved version of genetic programming gives the best results if many candidate rules can be evaluated, closely followed by the neural network representation that already leads to good results for small to moderate computational budgets. The linear representation is found to be competitive only for extremely small computational budgets.</p></span></span></span></li>

We divide the experimental scheme into two distinct scenarios: (1) evolving a decision-tree induction algorithm from multiple balanced data sets; and (2) evolving a decision-tree induction algorithm from multiple imbalanced data sets. In each of these scenarios, we analyse the difference in performance of well-known classification performance measures such as accuracy, F-Measure, AUC, recall, and also a lesser-known criterion, namely the relative accuracy improvement. In addition, we analyse different schemes of aggregation, such as simple average, median, and harmonic mean. Finally, we verify whether the best-performing fitness functions are capable of providing HEAD-DT with algorithms more effective than traditional decision-tree induction algorithms like C4.5, CART, and REPTree. Experimental results indicate that HEAD-DT is a good option for generating algorithms tailored to (im)balanced data, since it outperforms state-of-the-art decision-tree induction algorithms with statistical significance.</p></span></span></span></li>

A traditional hyper-heuristic framework has two levels, a high level strategy and a set of low level heuristics. The role of the high level strategy is to decide which low level heuristic should be executed at the current decision point. This paper proposes a Monte Carlo tree search hyper-heuristic framework. We model the search space of the low level heuristics as a tree and use Monte Carlo tree search to search through the tree in order to identify the best sequence of low level heuristics to be applied to the current state. To improve the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we couple it with a memory mechanism which contains a population of solutions, utilizing different population updating rules. The generality of the proposed framework is demonstrated using the six domains of the hyper-heuristic competition (CHeSC) test suite (boolean satisfiability (MAX-SAT), one dimensional bin packing, permutation flow shop, personnel scheduling, traveling salesman and vehicle routing with time windows). The results demonstrate that the proposed hyper-heuristic generalizes well over all six domains and obtains competitive, if not better results, when compared to the best known results that have previously been presented in the scientific literature.</p></span></span></span></li>

Various versions of this well-known industrial engineering problem can be faced frequently. Several heuristics have been proposed for the solution of 2DBPP but it has not been possible to find the exact solutions for large problem instances. Next fit, first fit, best fit, unified tabu search, genetic and memetic algorithms are some of the state-of-the-art methods successfully applied to this important problem. In this study, we propose a set of novel hyper-heuristic algorithms that select/combine the state-of-the-art heuristics and local search techniques for minimizing the number of 2D bins. The proposed algorithms introduce new crossover and mutation operators for the selection of the heuristics. Through the results of exhaustive experiments on a set of offline 2DBPP benchmark problem instances, we conclude that the proposed algorithms are robust with their ability to obtain high percentage of the optimal solutions.</p></span></span></span></li>

Solving a high school timetabling problem requires scheduling of resources and events into time slots subject to a set of constraints. Recently, an international competition, referred to as ITC 2011 was organised to determine the state-of-the-art approach for high school timetabling. The problem instances, obtained from eight different countries across the world used in this competition became a benchmark for further research in the field. Selection hyper-heuristics are general-purpose improvement methodologies that control/mix a given set of low level heuristics during the search process. In this study, we evaluate the performance of a range of selection hyper-heuristics combining different reusable components for high school timetabling. The empirical results show the success of the approach which embeds an adaptive great-deluge move acceptance method on the ITC 2011 benchmark instances. This selection hyper-heuristic ranks the second among the previously proposed approaches including the ones competed at ITC 2011.</p></span></span></span></li>

However, skilled software engineers waste significant effort designing such algorithms for a particular problem, adapting them, selecting operators and configuring parameters. Hyper-heuristics can help in these tasks by dynamically selecting or creating heuristics. Despite of such advantages, we observe a lack of works regarding this subject in the SBSE field. Considering this fact, this work introduces HITO, a Hyper-heuristic for the Integration and Test Order Problem. It includes a set of well-defined steps and is based on two selection functions (Choice Function and Multi-armed Bandit) to select the best low-level heuristic (combination of mutation and crossover operators) in each mating. To perform the selection, a quality measure is proposed to assess the performance of low-level heuristics throughout the evolutionary process. HITO was implemented using NSGA-II and evaluated to solve the integration and test order problem in seven systems. The introduced hyper-heuristic obtained the best results for all systems, when compared to a traditional algorithm.</p></span></span></span></li>

Traditional iterative selection hyper-heuristics rely on two key components, a heuristic selection method and a move acceptance criterion. Choice Function heuristic selection scores heuristics based on a combination of three measures, selecting the heuristic with the highest score. Modified Choice Function heuristic selection is a variant of the Choice Function which emphasises intensification over diversification within the heuristic search process. Previous work has shown that improved results are possible in some problem domains when using Modified Choice Function heuristic selection over the classic Choice Function, however in most of these cases crossover low-level heuristics (operators) are omitted. In this paper, we introduce crossover low-level heuristics into a Modified Choice Function selection hyper-heuristic and present results over six problem domains. It is observed that although on average there is an increase in performance when using crossover low-level heuristics, the benefit of using crossover can vary on a per-domain or per-instance basis.</p></span></span></span></li>

Hyper-heuristics aim to get such value by using a specific API such as 'HyFlex' to cleanly separate the search control structure from the details of the domain. Here, we discuss various longer-term additions to the HyFlex interface that will allow much richer information exchange, and so enhance learning via data science techniques, but without losing domain independence of the search control.</p></span></span></span></li>

This study presented a math-hyper-heuristic approach to tackle this problem more effectively and more efficiently. The proposed approach consists of two phases: a math phase and a hyper-heuristic phase. In the math phase, the problem is decomposed into sub-problems which are solved independently using the column generation algorithm. The solutions for these sub-problems are combined and then improved by the hyper-heuristic phase. Benchmark instances of large-scale vehicle routing problems with time windows were used for evaluation. The results show the effectiveness of the math phase.

However not all selection vectors and solution acceptance criteria pairings deliver competitive results when faced with differing problem instance features and computational time limits. We evaluate pairings of six different operator selection vectors and eight solution acceptance criteria, and monitor the performance of the adaptive hyper-heuristic when applying each pairing to a set of Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem instances of the same size but with different features. The results show that a few pairings of operator selection vector and acceptance criterion perform consistently well, while others require a longer computational time to deliver competitive results.

This paper proposes the use of a single hyperheuristic algorithm that learns search strategies across a broad range of problem instances, providing a single generalist approach. We have developed a Hyperheuristic algorithm for CIT, and report experiments that show that our algorithm competes with known best solutions across constrained and unconstrained problems: For all 26 real-world subjects, it equals or outperforms the best result previously reported in the literature.

The goal of algorithm portfolios is to construct a subset of algorithms with diverse problem solving capabilities. The portfolio is then used to select algorithms from for solving a particular (set of) instance(s). Traditionally, algorithm selection is usually performed in an offline manner and requires the need of domain knowledge about the target problem; while online algorithm selection techniques tend not to pay much attention to a careful construction of algorithm portfolios. By combining algorithm portfolios and online selection, our hope is to design a problem-independent hybrid strategy with diverse problem solving capability. We apply OSCAR to design a portfolio of memetic operator combinations, each including one crossover, one mutation and one local search rather than single operator selection. An empirical analysis is performed on the Quadratic Assignment and Flowshop Scheduling problems to verify the feasibility, efficacy, and robustness of our proposed approach.</p></span></span></span></li>

Previous work has shown that selection hyper-heuristics are able to solve many combinatorial optimisation problems, including the multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problem (MKP). The traditional framework for iterative selection hyper-heuristics relies on two key components, a heuristic selection method and a move acceptance criterion. Existing work has shown that a hyper-heuristic using Modified Choice Function heuristic selection can be effective at solving problems in multiple problem domains. Late Acceptance Strategy is a hill climbing metaheuristic strategy often used as a move acceptance criteria in selection hyper-heuristics. This work compares a Modified Choice Function - Late Acceptance Strategy hyper-heuristic to an existing selection hyper-heuristic method from the literature which has previously performed well on standard MKP benchmarks.</p></span></span></span></li>

- Hyper-heuristics are a class of high-level search techniques which operate on a search space of heuristics rather than directly on a search space of solutions. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the suitability of using genetic programming as a hyper-heuristic methodology to generate constructive heuristics to solve the multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problem
Design/methodology/approach
- Early hyper-heuristics focused on selecting and applying a low-level heuristic at each stage of a search. Recent trends in hyper-heuristic research have led to a number of approaches being developed to automatically generate new heuristics from a set of heuristic components. A population of heuristics to rank knapsack items are trained on a subset of test problems and then applied to unseen instances.
Findings
- The results over a set of standard benchmarks show that genetic programming can be used to generate constructive heuristics which yield human-competitive results.
Originality/value
- In this work the authors show that genetic programming is suitable as a method to generate reusable constructive heuristics for the multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problem. This is classified as a hyper-heuristic approach as it operates on a search space of heuristics rather than a search space of solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first time in the literature a GP hyper-heuristic has been used to solve the multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problem. The results suggest that using GP to evolve ranking mechanisms merits further future research effort.</p></span></span></span></li>

The goal is to maximise the average bin fullness after placement of a long stream of items. A recent work describes an approach for solving this problem based on a 'policy matrix' representation in which each decision option is independently given a value and the highest value option is selected. A policy matrix can also be viewed as a heuristic with many parameters and then the search for a good policy matrix can be treated as a parameter tuning process. In this study, we show that the Irace parameter tuning algorithm produces heuristics which outperform the standard human designed heuristics for various instances of the online bin packing problem.</p></span></span></span></li>

This area of bio-inspired intelligent systems covers a wide range of algorithms selection techniques. This type of self-organising mechanism uses heuristics to optimise heuristics. Many discussions focus on the quality of solutions of the problems obtained from the hyper-heuristics, very little discussion concentrates on the generated algorithms themselves. Some hyper-heuristic frameworks tend to be highly constrained, their limited instruction sets prevent the state-of-the-art algorithms from being expressed. In addition, often the generated algorithms are not human-readable. In this paper, we propose a possible extension of some existing hyper-heuristic formulations, so that some of the current open issues can be addressed and it becomes possible to produce self-organizing heuristics that adapt themselves automatically to the environment when the class of problems changes. This together with the analysis of the evolved algorithms, may lead to human-competitive results.</p></span></span></span></li>

However, there has been no comprehensive empirical study of different search algorithms across multiple different real world datasets. In this paper we present an empirical study of global, local and hybrid meta- and hyper-heuristic search based algorithms on 10 real world datasets. We find that the hyper-heuristics are particularly effective. For example, the hyper-heuristic genetic algorithm significantly outperformed the other six approaches (and with high effect size) for solution quality 85% of the time, and was also faster than all others 70% of the time. Furthermore, correlation analysis reveals that it scales well as the number of requirements increases.</p></span></span></span></li>

Hyper-heuristics are high level search methodologies that operate on the space of heuristics to solve hard computational problems. A frequently used hyper-heuristic framework mixes a predefined set of low level heuristics during the search process. While most of the work on such selection hyper-heuristics in the literature are empirical, we analyse the runtime of the hyper-heuristics rigorously. Our initial analysis shows that mixing heuristics could lead to exponentially faster search than individual (deterministically chosen) heuristics on chosen problems. Both mixing of variation operators and mixing of acceptance criteria are investigated on some selected problems. It is shown that mixing operators is only efficient with the right mixing distribution (parameter setting). Additionally, some of the existing adaptation mechanisms for mixing operators are also evaluated.</p></span></span></span></li>

Early hyper-heuristic research focussed on selecting and applying a low-level heuristic at a given stage of an optimisation process. Recent trends have led to a number of approaches being developed to automatically generate heuristics for a number of combinatorial optimisation problems. Previous work on the VRP has shown that the application of hyper-heuristic approaches can yield successful results. In this paper we investigate the potential of grammatical evolution as a method to evolve the components of a variable neighbourhood search (VNS) framework. In particular, two components are generated; constructive heuristics to create initial solutions and neighbourhood move operators to change the state of a given solution. The proposed method is tested on standard benchmark instances of two common VRP variants.</p></span></span></span></li>

This paper introduces a single hyperheuristic algorithm that earns CIT strategies, providing a single generalist approach. We report experiments that show that our algorithm competes with known best solutions across constrained and unconstrained problems. For all 26 real world subjects and 29 of the 30 constrained benchmark problems studied, it equals or improves upon the best known result. We also present evidence that our algorithm's strong generic performance is caused by its effective unsupervised learning. Hyperheuristic search is thus a promising way to relocate CIT design intelligence from human to machine.</p></span></span></span></li>

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the suitability of using genetic programming as a hyper-heuristic methodology to generate constructive heuristics to solve the multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problem. Design/methodology/approach: Early hyper-heuristics focused on selecting and applying a low-level heuristic at each stage of a search. Recent trends in hyper-heuristic research have led to a number of approaches being developed to automatically generate new heuristics from a set of heuristic components. A population of heuristics to rank knapsack items are trained on a subset of test problems and then applied to unseen instances. Findings: The results over a set of standard benchmarks show that genetic programming can be used to generate constructive heuristics which yield human-competitive results. Originality/value: In this work the authors show that genetic programming is suitable as a method to generate reusable constructive heuristics for the multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problem. This is classified as a hyper-heuristic approach as it operates on a search space of heuristics rather than a search space of solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first time in the literature a GP hyper-heuristic has been used to solve the multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problem. The results suggest that using GP to evolve ranking mechanisms merits further future research effort.</p></span></span></span></li>

Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, the traditional exact approaches might fail to find a solution even for a given instance. Hyper-heuristics which search the space of heuristics for high quality solutions are alternative methods that have been increasingly used in solving such problems. In this study, a curriculum based course timetabling problem at Yeditepe University is described. An improvement oriented heuristic selection strategy combined with a simulated annealing move acceptance as a hyper-heuristic utilizing a set of low level constraint oriented neighbourhood heuristics is investigated for solving this problem. The proposed hyper-heuristic was initially developed to handle a variety of problems in a particular domain with different properties considering the nature of the low level heuristics. On the other hand, a goal of hyper-heuristic development is to build methods which are general.

The EA evolves divisions of variable quantity and dimension that represent ranges of a bin's capacity and are used to train a k-nearest neighbour algorithm. Once trained the classifier selects a single deterministic heuristic to solve each one of a large set of unseen problem instances. The evolved classifier is shown to achieve results significantly better than are obtained by any of the constituent heuristics when used in isolation.</p></span></span></span></li>

The most successful strategy for inducing decision trees, the greedy top-down approach, has been continuously improved by researchers over the years. This work, following recent breakthroughs in the automatic design of machine learning algorithms, proposes a hyper-heuristic evolutionary algorithm for automatically generating decision-tree induction algorithms, named HEAD-DT. We perform extensive experiments in 20 public data sets to assess the performance of HEAD-DT, and we compare it to traditional decision-tree algorithms such as C4.5 and CART. Results show that HEAD-DT can generate algorithms that significantly outperform C4.5 and CART regarding predictive accuracy and F-Measure.</p></span></span></span></li>

These technologies are very useful for users who do not need the exact solution but who care very much about the response time. For every existing heuristic algorithm has its pros and cons, a hyper-heuristic clustering algorithm based on the diversity detection and improvement detection operators to determine when to switch from one heuristic algorithm to another is presented to improve the clustering result in this paper. Several well-known datasets are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can provide a better clustering result than the state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms compared in this paper, namely, k-means, simulated annealing, tabu search, and genetic k-means algorithm.</p></span></span></span></li>

A iterative selection hyper-heuristic framework based on single-point search relies on two key components, a heuristic selection method and a move acceptance criteria. The Choice Function is an elegant heuristic selection method which scores heuristics based on a combination of three different measures and applies the heuristic with the highest rank at each given step. Each measure is weighted appropriately to provide balance between intensification and diversification during the heuristic search process. Choosing the right parameter values to weight these measures is not a trivial process and a small number of methods have been proposed in the literature. In this study we describe a new method, inspired by reinforcement learning, which controls these parameters automatically. The proposed method is tested and compared to previous approaches over a standard benchmark across six problem domains.</p></span></span></span></li>

This problem often exhibits a noisy environment due to the properties of the race track as well as the components of the car. Selection hyper-heuristics are methodologies that control and mix different predefined set of heuristics during the search process for solving computationally hard problems. In this study, we represent the car setup problem as a real valued optimisation problem and investigate the performance of different approaches including a set of heuristics and their combination controlled by a selection hyper-heuristic framework. The results show that selection hyper-heuristics and a tuned heuristic perform well and are promising approaches even in a dynamically changing, noisy environment.</p></span></span></span></li>

A particular approach which has been receiving attention in the recent years is based on variable ordering using hyper-heuristics. A hyper-heuristic decides the next variable to process using a set of predefined heuristics considering the features that describe the instance at a given point during the search in this framework. This study explores an approach in which each hyper-heuristic is represented as a set of vectors mapping instance features to heuristics for variable ordering. The results suggest that the proposed approach is able to combine the strengths of different heuristics and compensate for their weaknesses performing better than each heuristic in isolation across a range of instances.</p></span></span></span></li>

The LCS based hyperheuristic is built from multi-objective low-level heuristics that are derived from an existing MFMP solver. While the low-level heuristics use multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to search non-dominated solutions, the LCS based hyperheuristic applies the non-dominance concept at the primitive heuristic level. Two LCS, namely the eXtended Classifier System (XCS) and the sUpervised Classifier System (UCS) are augmented by multi-objective reward and accuracy functions, respectively. The results show that UCS performs better than XCS: the hyperheuristic learned by the UCS is able to select low-level heuristics which create MFMP solutions that, in terms of a distance-based convergence metric, are closer to the derived global Pareto curves on a large set of MFMP test scenarios than the solutions created by heuristics that are selected by the XCS hyperheuristic.</p></span></span></span></li>

To achieve this, a number of heuristic sets was generated for the patient admission scheduling problem by setting the parameters of a set of parametric heuristics with specific values. These values were set such that nine heuristic sets with different improvement capabilities, speed characteristics and size were generated. A group of hyper-heuristics with certain selection mechanisms and acceptance criteria having dissimilar intensification/diversification abilities were taken from the literature enabling a comprehensive analysis. The experimental results indicated that different hyper-heuristics perform superiorly on distinct heuristic sets. The results can be explained and hence result in hyper-heuristic design recommendations.</p></span></span></span></li>

The resulting algorithm is expected to be effective for solving a given set of target problem instances. However, since the algorithm is dedicated, it is hard to adapt and to apply to other problems. Meta-heuristics were brought in to cope with this drawback. Nevertheless, in most of the meta-heuristic studies, the employed meta-heuristics have been implemented as rather problem-dependent methodologies. Hyper-heuristics furnish problem-independent management opportunities differently from such search and optimisation algorithms. The present dissertation focuses on the generality of hyper-heuristics. It thereby aims at designing intelligent hyper-heuristics so that generality is facilitated. While most works on hyper-heuristics make use of the term generality in describing the potential for solving various problems, the performance changes across different domains have only rarely been reported. Additionally, there are other generality related elements such as the performance variations over distinct heuristic sets, that are usually ignored. This means that there is no study fully discussing generality questions while providing a hyper-heuristic design capable of addressing them.To this end, the factors affecting the hyper-heuristics' generality are determined and several novel hyper-heuristic components are developed based on these factors. Then, the hyper-heuristics using the new components are tested across various problem domains on different heuristic sets, while also varying the experimental limits. First, each developed hyper-heuristic is applied to only one problem domain. The performance of these hyper-heuristics is compared with other algorithms encountered in the literature. The information gathered during these experiments is used later on to design a highly adaptive, intelligent selection hyper-heuristic.The ultimate result of the present PhD research is called the Generic Intelligent Hyper-heuristic (GIHH). It is equipped with multiple online adaptive hyper-heuristic procedures and decision mechanisms for simultaneously coordinating them. GIHH is expected to evolve for different search environments without human intervention. A simplified version of GIHH is tested via a series of experiments on three problems from practice to measure its generality level. A comprehensive performance analysis is conducted using a group of selection hyper-heuristics only involving heuristic selection and move acceptance mechanisms from the literature. The analysis provides strong conclusions about when a hyper-heuristic with certain characteristics has advantages or disadvantages.Finally, GIHH is tested on other challenging combinatorial optimisation problems under different empirical conditions. The computational results indicate that GIHH is effective in solving the target instances from distinct problem domains. Additionally, GIHH won the first international cross domain heuristic search challenge 2011 against 19 high-level algorithms developed by the other academic competitors. The winning hyper-heuristic was then used to investigate the performance and contribution of low-level heuristics while simultaneously solving three problems with routing and rostering characteristics. This completely new application of a hyper-heuristic offers promising perspectives for supporting dedicated heuristic development.</p></span></span></span></li>

This has consequences for the use of genetic programming as a method to discover new search algorithms and, more generally, problem solvers. Furthermore, it has also rather important philosophical consequences in relation to the efforts of computer scientists to discover useful novel search algorithms.</p></span></span></span></li>

The hyperheuristic manages the choice of which lowerlevel heuristic method should be applied at any given time, depending upon the characteristics of the region of the solution space currently under exploration. We analyse the behaviour of several different hyperheuristic approaches for a real-world personnel scheduling problem. Results obtained show the effectiveness of our approach for this problem and suggest wider applicability of hyperheuristic approaches to other problems of scheduling and combinatorial optimisation.</p></span></span></span></li>

There are two aims. The first is to circumvent the problems posed by a direct chromosome representation for the ETTP that consists of an array of events in which each value represents the timeslot which the corresponding event is assigned to. The second is to show that the adaptation of particular features in both the instance of the problem to be solved and the strategies used to solve it provides encouraging results for real ETTPs. There is much scope for investigating such approaches further, not only for the ETTP, but also for other related scheduling problems.</p></span></span></span></li>
